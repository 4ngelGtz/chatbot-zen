1
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,875
have you ever thought you had life completely

2
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:10,833
figured out

3
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:13,541
only to realize it was playing you the entire time

4
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:15,791
maybe you thought you'd beaten the system

5
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:17,291
cracked the code to success

6
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,166
or found the perfect shortcut

7
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:20,625
to skip all the hard work

8
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:24,000
and then reality hit you like a freight train

9
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,583
well there's an ancient story about someone

10
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,916
who thought he could outsmart the universe itself

11
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:33,583
his name was Sun Wukong the Monkey King

12
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,291
this guy didn't just think he was clever

13
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,750
he literally declared war on heaven

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,708
defeated every god in existence

15
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:42,500
and then

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,250
had the audacity to challenge Buddha to a contest

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,750
what happened next

18
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:52,208
the most epic ego shattering moment in all of mythology

19
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:55,458
where infinite power met infinite wisdom

20
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,625
and the outcome will completely change

21
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,125
how you see every challenge

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,166
every setback and every moment

23
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,458
you thought you were in control

24
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,958
because here's the twist we're all the Monkey King

25
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,125
we're all trying to escape Buddha's palm

26
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,250
through side hustles

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,250
thinking we found some secret everyone else missed

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,000
but maybe just maybe

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,708
we never left that palm at all

30
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,000
ready to have your mind blown

31
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:23,416
this story comes from journey to the west

32
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,916
one of the greatest adventure novels ever written

33
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,333
during the Ming Dynasty

34
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,416
now this isn't literal Buddhist scripture

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,416
it's wisdom wrapped in adventure

36
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,833
like Marvel movies with a deeper meaning

37
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,791
these themes about pride and humility

38
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,958
they're older than Buddhism itself

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,250
every culture has stories about the fall that follows

40
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,041
arrogance

41
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,416
Sun Wukong inspired everything from Dragon Ball

42
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,291
to Marvel's Monkey King comics

43
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:52,291
he's basically the ultimate anime protagonist

44
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,250
if that protagonist had absolutely zero chill

45
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,166
and an ego the size of the universe

46
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,666
we're talking about someone who Learned

47
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,583
72 different transformations

48
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:05,291
can travel 34,000 miles in a single jump

49
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:09,541
carries a staff that weighs 17,500 pounds

50
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,333
but shrinks to fit behind his ear

51
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,416
and made himself immortal

52
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,541
not just regular immortal

53
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,583
seven different types of immortality

54
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,000
stacked on top of each other

55
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:22,041
but unlimited power plus zero wisdom

56
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,958
that's a recipe for divine disaster

57
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,583
so how does someone who literally cannot be killed

58
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,250
who defeated heaven itself

59
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:31,833
meet his match

60
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,416
and what does this have to do with that time

61
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,458
you thought you'd figured everything out

62
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,458
you're about to find out and once you see it

63
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,166
you'll never look at your own limitations the same way

64
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:42,958
again

65
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,666
so who exactly is this monkey King

66
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,708
and how does someone go from being just another monkey

67
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,000
to literally making the gods themselves

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,125
shake in their boots

69
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,125
Sun Wukong starts as a regular monkey on a mountain

70
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,916
but this guy has ambition

71
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,000
that would make every entrepreneur jealous

72
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,583
he looks at his simple monkey life and thinks nah

73
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,750
this isn't enough I want immortality

74
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,166
so he finds a Taoist master

75
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,166
and learns the secrets of transformation

76
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,791
magic and eternal life

77
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,375
but one type of immortality isn't enough for his ego

78
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,500
this guy collects different forms of eternal life

79
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,166
like they're going out of style

80
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,458
immortal through meditation check

81
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,041
immortal from eating magical peaches

82
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,541
check immortal by drinking divine elixir

83
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:36,875
check

84
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,083
he even erases his name from the book of death

85
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,291
at some point even death gave up trying

86
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,875
then he gets his hands on a legendary staff

87
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,166
that weighs 17,500 pounds

88
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,666
but responds to his thoughts

89
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,625
it can grow to support the heavens

90
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,458
or shrink to fit behind his ear

91
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,625
and that's when unlimited power meets zero wisdom

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,208
Sun Wukong marches into heaven

93
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,416
demands respect

94
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,708
gets insulted with the lowest job possible

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,833
and declares war on the entire celestial realm

96
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,625
one monkey versus 100,000 heavenly warriors

97
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,958
and he wins

98
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,666
actually laughing

99
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,541
while dismantling the most powerful army in existence

100
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,666
sound familiar this is every success story gone wrong

101
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:24,000
talent plus opportunity minus wisdom equals chaos

102
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,083
and Sun Wukong

103
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,166
he was about to learn that the universe keeps score

104
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,666
differently than he thought

105
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,375
he broke heaven

106
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,250
so what happens when heaven breaks back

107
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,500
picture this scene the Jade Emperor

108
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,041
ruler of the entire universe

109
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,125
sitting on his throne

110
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,666
probably stress eating celestial snacks

111
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,666
trying to figure out how to deal with one

112
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,541
incredibly powerful monkey

113
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,458
who just made his

114
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,791
entire army look like weekend warriors

115
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,666
this isn't just embarrassing

116
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,416
this is a cosmic crisis

117
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,000
because if one monkey can waltz into heaven

118
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,500
beat up all the gods and declare himself great sage

119
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,583
equal to heaven

120
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,333
what does that say about divine authority

121
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,000
they tried everything everything

122
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,541
more troops

123
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,583
Sun Wukong just cloned himself

124
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,666
and fought entire battalions at once

125
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,333
while probably making monkey jokes the whole time

126
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,625
magical weapons the monkey laughed

127
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,416
and turned his staff

128
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,291
into whatever he needed to counter them

129
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,250
they even tried negotiation

130
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:28,833
okay fine

131
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,291
you can have a higher rank

132
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,333
but ego is never satisfied

133
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,458
give it an inch it demands the whole universe

134
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,916
and that's when the Jade Emperor realizes something

135
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:38,875
terrifying

136
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,541
this isn't a problem you can solve with more power

137
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:43,291
because

138
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,000
when someone has collected every possible advantage

139
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:49,583
when they've made themselves literally unkillable

140
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,291
traditional force becomes useless

141
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,625
so the Jade Emperor does something

142
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,875
no supreme ruler ever wants to do

143
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,250
he admits he's completely out of his league

144
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,875
he makes the call that changes everything

145
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,416
he calls Buddha not for more power

146
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,583
not for bigger weapons but for wisdom

147
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,125
because sometimes

148
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,208
the biggest problems require a completely

149
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,208
different approach

150
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:13,875
and Buddha

151
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,041
Buddha says

152
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,000
something that probably made every god in heaven

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,750
do a double take send him to me

154
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,041
one monkey thinks he outsmarted heaven

155
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:23,291
but

156
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,000
what happens when infinite ego meets infinite wisdom

157
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,375
so Sun Wukong swaggers into Buddha's presence

158
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,666
probably expecting another fight

159
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,166
another chance to show off his incredible powers

160
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,833
and instead Buddha just sits there calmly

161
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,833
like he's waiting for a bus

162
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,166
Sun Wukong brought thunder

163
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,416
Buddha brought silence and silence is undefeated

164
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,458
this drives the Monkey King absolutely crazy

165
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,416
because his whole strategy is intimidation

166
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,875
through overwhelming force

167
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,541
but you can't intimidate someone

168
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,125
who looks at your cosmic rampage

169
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,875
and just smiles

170
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,375
but Buddha doesn't want to crush Sun Wukong

171
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,791
he wants to teach him

172
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,958
and you can't teach someone by overpowering them

173
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,958
you have to let them discover the truth themselves

174
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,500
so Buddha makes

175
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,875
what sounds like the most casual bet in history

176
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,333
I hear you're quite powerful

177
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,541
tell me can you escape from my palm

178
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,791
now to Sun Wukong this sounds ridiculous

179
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,041
he can travel 34,000 miles in a single somersault

180
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,500
he's been to the edge of the universe and back

181
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:34,625
and this guy wants to know if he can escape from a hand

182
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,208
the Monkey King literally laughs

183
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,458
are you serious

184
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,333
I can fly beyond the pillars that hold up the sky

185
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,541
your palm

186
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,958
that's not even a warm up

187
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,500
Buddha extends his right hand

188
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,333
it's not particularly large

189
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,333
doesn't glow with cosmic energy

190
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:55,208
doesn't look threatening at all just a hand

191
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:00,208
go ahead Buddha says show me

192
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,666
soon Wukong isn't just showing off here

193
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,583
he's desperate to prove he matters

194
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,708
that business launch

195
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,791
where you needed everyone to see you succeed

196
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,458
that moment you posted something

197
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,791
hoping for validation

198
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,708
we've all been the monkey trying to prove our worth

199
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,583
Sun Wukong jumps into Buddha's palm

200
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,500
takes one look around and thinks

201
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,166
this is going to be the easiest victory of his life

202
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,291
he was so so wrong

203
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,625
he thought he reached the edge of everything

204
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,958
but some edges are just the beginning

205
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,916
so Sun Wukong launches himself into the air

206
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,125
and starts flying

207
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,333
not just flying we're talking about the cosmic

208
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,916
equivalent of a rocket ship

209
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,958
this guy is moving so fast

210
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,291
that stars blur past him

211
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,000
like street lights on a highway

212
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,375
he's flying for what feels like hours

213
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,583
days maybe even years

214
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,416
and the whole time he's thinking

215
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,541
this is too easy

216
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,875
Buddha must be testing my determination

217
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,625
but I've got this locked down

218
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,125
finally

219
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,541
finally

220
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,916
he sees something in the distance

221
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,791
five massive pink pillars

222
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,791
stretching from the ground

223
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,625
all the way up into infinity

224
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,541
and Sun Wukong thinks

225
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,916
perfect these must be the pillars that hold up the sky

226
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,375
the literal edge of existence

227
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,541
he lands looks around and realizes he's made it

228
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,916
he's actually reached the boundary of the universe

229
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:32,750
itself places where even gods don't dare to travel

230
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,875
but reaching the edge of existence

231
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:38,083
isn't enough for his ego he needs proof

232
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,291
he needs everyone to know that Sun Wukong was here

233
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,083
first

234
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,000
so what does he do

235
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,000
he writes graffiti at the edge of the universe

236
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,958
this guy pulls out a brush and writes

237
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,083
on one of the pillars

238
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,000
Sun Wukong the great sage

239
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,916
equal to heaven was here

240
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,791
but that's still not enough proof for him

241
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,458
so he and this is going to sound gross

242
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,041
but it's in the original story

243
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:05,458
he marks his territory like a dog

244
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,750
at the base of the first pillar

245
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,750
yeah the guy who thinks he's equal to heaven just

246
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,083
well you get the picture

247
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,791
then he flies all the way back

248
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,291
probably

249
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,958
the most confident he's ever been in his entire life

250
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,583
he lands in Buddha's palm with this massive grin

251
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,333
and says done

252
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,625
I flew to the pillars at the edge of existence

253
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,458
I marked my territory I even left my signature

254
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,250
now pay up

255
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,833
and Buddha just smiles really

256
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,958
you went to the edge of existence

257
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,416
let me show you something

258
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:45,166
Buddha slowly raises his right hand and turns it over

259
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,541
the moment the oh crap moment

260
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,416
the ego shattering

261
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,958
mind melting reveal that changes everything

262
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,625
there on Buddha's middle finger

263
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:59,250
written in Sun Wukong's own handwriting are the words

264
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,833
Sun Wukong the great Sage

265
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,875
equal to heaven was here

266
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,291
and at the base of Buddha's thumb

267
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:10,000
yeah that smell the Monkey King was wondering about

268
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,208
the pillars at the edge of existence

269
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,750
they weren't pillars at all

270
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,541
they were Buddha's fingers

271
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:16,500
turns out

272
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,083
the edge of the universe was just the edge of a finger

273
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,375
he thought he escaped truth

274
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,833
but truth never moved

275
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,083
Sun Wukong never left the palm

276
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:29,416
not even close when unlimited power meets unlimited ego

277
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,125
what's the only cure

278
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,666
the look on Sun Wukong's face

279
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,500
imagine every time you thought you were being clever

280
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,291
and then realized

281
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,375
everyone else was three steps ahead of you

282
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,583
multiply that by infinity

283
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,083
his whole reality just collapsed

284
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,500
everything he thought he knew about his own power

285
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,625
his own intelligence his own place in the universe

286
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,333
gone in one devastating moment

287
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,208
and Buddha he doesn't gloat

288
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,125
he doesn't mock him he just says very gently

289
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,375
you never left my palm

290
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,833
now most stories would end here

291
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,000
with some kind of cosmic punishment right

292
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,625
lightning bolts eternal torture

293
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,541
being erased from existence

294
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,625
but Buddha does something completely different

295
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,708
he turns his hand over and those same fingers

296
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,250
that Sun Wukong mistook for the pillars of existence

297
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,625
they become a mountain

298
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,375
and that mountain pins the Monkey King to the earth

299
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,000
500 years

300
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,625
that's how long Sun Wukong spends under that mountain

301
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,666
no Wi-Fi no Doordash

302
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,250
no flexing in the comments

303
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,416
just you and your thoughts

304
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,458
but that mountain isn't punishment

305
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,625
it's not revenge it's a pause button

306
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,791
see Sun Wukong spent his whole life moving

307
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,291
fighting acquiring power

308
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,375
proving himself

309
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:50,583
never stopping

310
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,500
to actually think about what he was doing

311
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,541
or why

312
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,208
the mountain forces him to be still

313
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,083
to actually sit with himself

314
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,458
for the first time in his existence

315
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,666
and that's when the real transformation happens

316
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,125
not through more power

317
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,000
not through winning another battle

318
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,583
but through stillness

319
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,500
through being forced to confront who he really is

320
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,791
underneath all that ego and bluster

321
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,541
sometimes the universe doesn't stop you

322
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,958
it lets you exhaust yourself

323
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,125
the mountain teaches

324
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,000
what no amount of fighting ever could

325
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,583
humility and humility

326
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,666
that's the first step toward actual wisdom

327
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,958
stillness isn't failure

328
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,833
it's the beginning of transformation

329
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,333
in Buddhism they call it the middle way

330
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,625
the place between trying and giving up

331
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,875
between chasing and sitting still

332
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,250
because when Sun Wukong finally gets

333
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,583
out from under that mountain

334
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,708
he's not the same monkey

335
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,625
who thought he could outsmart the universe

336
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,041
he's finally ready to learn what real power

337
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,416
actually looks like

338
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,083
so what does a 500 year old story

339
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,916
about an arrogant monkey have to do with your life

340
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,125
everything because we're all Sun Wukong

341
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,666
every single one of us

342
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,500
we're all trying to escape Buddha's palm

343
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,541
through something crypto gains

344
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,541
side hustles

345
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,083
thinking we found the one hack everyone else missed

346
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,208
every entrepreneur thinking they found the secret sauce

347
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:13,916
every person

348
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,250
believing their growth strategy is revolutionary

349
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,291
we're all trying to escape someone's palm

350
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,916
but maybe we were never outside it to begin with

351
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,125
when was the last time you thought you had everything

352
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,416
figured out when you found that perfect strategy

353
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,875
that foolproof plan

354
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,333
that shortcut that was going to change everything

355
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,125
and then reality hit

356
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,958
and you realized you weren't as clever as you thought

357
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,708
that's your Buddha's palm moment

358
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,333
that's when life gently reminds you

359
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,708
that the universe is way bigger

360
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,250
and way smarter than your ego wants to admit

361
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,208
but those moments aren't punishments

362
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,833
they're teachings every time life humbles you

363
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,083
every time your plans fall apart

364
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:59,041
every time you realize you're not in control

365
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,416
that's not failure that's your mountain

366
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,708
that's life forcing you to pause

367
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,250
to be still to figure out who you actually are

368
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,250
underneath all the hustle and the proving

369
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,208
and the constant need to be right

370
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,875
so what's your personal mountain

371
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,958
what's the thing that's keeping you still right now

372
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,666
that you think is holding you back

373
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,125
but might actually be exactly what you need to grow

374
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,333
