00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,400
when the original Buddha's teachings

117
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,800

118
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,560
he'll essentially reboot spirituality

130
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,880

131
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,199
Buddhist schools interpret mraa in their

132
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,000
own ways in theava Buddhism he's seen as

133
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,759
a future Buddha but doesn't play a

a full-fledged bodhisatwa

140
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,639

401
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,279
already here Incognito waiting for the

402

right moment to reveal himself it adds a

403
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:40,880
layer of mystery to the whole concept

404
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,360

relevance in each era and art

413
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,120
form mraa vers the

414
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,079
Messiah let's play a game of Spot the

415
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,520
Difference with two of history's most

416
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,799
anticipated arrivals mraa and the

417
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,919
Messiah it's an interesting comparison

418
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:22,160
that reveals both similarities and key

419
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:24,400
differences first let's talk timing both

420
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,000
mraa and the Messiah are expected to

421
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,640
arrive during challenging times they're

422
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,240
like Cosmic problem solvers set to

423
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,520
appear when the world needs them most

424
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,080
now for their roles the Messiah comes to

425
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,600
bring Salvation and judge the world

426
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,799
combining the roles of Savior and judge

427
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,480
mraa on the other hand arrives as a

428
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,799
teacher here to share wisdom and guide

429
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,600
everyone to

430
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,440
Enlightenment both figures are

431
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,640
associated with major world

432
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,880
Transformations the messiah's arrival is

433
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,159
said to usher in a Divine Kingdom while

434
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,600
mraa Heralds a new golden age of

435
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:01,080
spirituality and wisdom both Concepts

436
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,360
Envision a radical Improvement in the

437
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,840
world's condition when it comes to their

438
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,799
followers both mraa and the Messiah have

439
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,760
devoted Believers some people eagerly

440
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,720
anticipate their arrival looking for

441
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,799
signs and preparing for their

442
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,679
coming let's talk background the Messiah

443
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:21,640
is part of a lineage of prophets in

444
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,760
judeo-christian Tradition mraa meanwhile

445
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,799
is one in a line of Buddhas and Buddhist

446
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,000
thought both are part of larger

447
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:29,840
spiritual

448
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,760
narratives interestingly both Traditions

449
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,480
have seen individuals claim to be these

450
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,960
awaited figures it's a phenomenon that

451
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,440
highlights the powerful appeal of these

452
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,360
Concepts here's a key difference while

453
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,679
the Messiah is unique to judeo-christian

454
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,840
Traditions the concept of mraa has

455
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,080
variations across different Buddhist

456
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,760
cultures this reflects buddhism's

457
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,559
tendency to adapt to different cultural

458
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,400
contexts despite their differences many

459
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:58,320
modern thinkers see mraa and the Messiah

460
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,280
as cultural expressions of a similar

461
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,000
hope the desire for a better future

462
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,120
Guided by higher wisdom so there you

463
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,919
have it mraa and the Messiah two long-

464
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,400
awaited spiritual figures with some

465
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:13,360
surprising similarities and important

466
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,559
differences whether you're waiting for a

467
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,600
teacher or a judge a new age or a Divine

468
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,320
Kingdom these Concepts reflect

469
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,320
Humanity's enduring hope for a better

470
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,840
future

471
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,360
MythBusters debunking mraa

472
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,840
misconceptions

473
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,360
let's clear up some confusion about mraa

474
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,280
there are quite a few misunderstandings

475
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,720
floating around so let's set the record

476
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,240
straight first a big one mraa is the

477
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,520
Buddhist version of the

478
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,960
Messiah while these two figures share

479
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,120
some similarities they're not

480
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,039
interchangeable mraa isn't coming to

481
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,760
judge or bring Salvation in the same way

482
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:55,200
as the Messiah he's more of a universal

483
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,360
teacher here to share wisdom and guide

484
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,280
beings to

485
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:02,240
Enlightenment another misconception

486
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,000
mraa is coming to end the world that's

487
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,679
not quite right mraa isn't arriving with

488
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,200
any destructive intent instead he's

489
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,640
coming to usher in a new age of

490
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,480
spiritual understanding think of him

491
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,080
more as a renovator than a Demolisher

492
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,480
here's an interesting one mraa is

493
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,679
already here disguised as a famous

494
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,320
person while some individuals have

495
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:28,159
claimed to be mraa Buddhist texts

496
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,840
describe his arrival as unmistakable he

497
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,000
said to have specific physical

498
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,440
characteristics and perform miraculous

499
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,760
acts that would be hard to miss or keep

500
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,840
secret some people believe that

501
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,000
worshiping mraa will speed up his

502
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,760
arrival however Buddhist teachings

503
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,400
suggest that mata's appearance depends

504
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,520
on specific conditions in the world not

505
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,360
on how many followers he has it's not a

506
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,720
popularity contest a more modern

507
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,600
misconception metrea is the leader of a

508
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,760
new world order this idea mixes up

509
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,679
Buddhist concepts with modern conspiracy

510
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,360
theories metra's mission is spiritual

511
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,360
enlightenment not world domination or

512
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,600
political

513
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:12,919
control lastly some think that only

514
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,320
Buddhists benefit from mata's arrival

515
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:17,640
actually Buddhist texts describe mra's

516
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,279
teachings as beneficial for all beings

517
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,559
regardless of their beliefs his wisdom

518
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,960

519
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:26,559

good to check reliable sources and

522

understand the

523
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:35,000
context misconceptions can spread easily

524
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,640
but a little knowledge goes a long way

525
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,640
