1
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:10,583
in a quiet study in Switzerland 1939

2
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:11,833
Carl Jung wrote

3
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,875
something that would challenge everything we think

4
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,125
about who we are

5
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,166
after decades of treating patients

6
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:20,708
and exploring the depths of human consciousness

7
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,416
he encountered an ancient truth that seemed impossible

8
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,916
a 2500 year old teaching of the Buddha

9
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,875
that suggested the self he spent his life studying

10
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,791
might not exist at all

11
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,291
yet Jung wasn't deterred

12
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,375
instead he wrote...

13
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,875
most sensible and most direct of all religions

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,375
what did this giant of western psychology

15
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,041
see in Buddhist teachings

16
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,875
and more importantly what happens

17
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:47,791
when these two

18
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,916
profound perspectives on human consciousness collide

19
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,291
the tension between these ideas

20
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,916
holds the key to unlocking a deeper truth

21
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,250
hello I'm Peter from Buddha's wisdom

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,875
before we explore this profound paradox

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,583
let's set the stage

24
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,500
picture two moments in history

25
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:16,000
first beneath the Bodhi Tree in ancient India

26
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,500
where Siddhartha Gautama realizes the truth of no self

27
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,208
that our sense of a permanent

28
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,833
unchanging self is an illusion

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,041
this radical insight would become

30
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,250
one of Buddhism's core teachings

31
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,833
now fast forward to the early 20th century

32
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:32,875
Carl Jung

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,625
already famous for his work on the human psyche

34
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:39,250
sits in his study surrounded by eastern texts

35
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,666
he's developing his theory of the self

36
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,291
as the center of psychological wholeness

37
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,666
seemingly the exact opposite of Buddhist teaching

38
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:49,958
these two perspectives

39
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,166
shaped how millions understand themselves

40
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:55,000
but here's what makes this truly fascinating

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,041
both ideas work

42
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,500
both have helped countless people find peace

43
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:01,791
and healing

44
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,750
both are supported by modern research

45
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,125
how is this possible? we'll see

46
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,291
how Jung and Buddha develop

47
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,166
their revolutionary insights

48
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,958
their true meaning of self and no self

49
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,333
and the surprising ways

50
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,500
these ideas compliment each other

51
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,875
more than mere philosophy

52
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,666
this understanding holds practical power

53
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,791
to transform your daily life

54
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,750
let's turn back the clock

55
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,875
to understand the historical context

56
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,375
that shaped these revolutionary ideas

57
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,041
our story begins in the vibrant streets of 19th century

58
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:41,875
Germany

59
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,708
where a young philosopher named Arthur Schopenhauer

60
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,916
first introduced Buddhist ideas

61
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,125
to western intellectual circles

62
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,875
his work would later captivate a young Carl Jung

63
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,333
opening his eyes to eastern wisdom

64
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,500
Jung wrote in his memoirs

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,875
Schopenhauer was the first to speak of

66
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,375
the suffering of the world

67
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,250
which visibly and glaringly surrounds us

68
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:08,083
and of confusion passion evil

69
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,625
this connection deepened in 1909

70
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,125
when Jung encountered Richard Wilhelm

71
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,708
the renowned Chinese classics translator

72
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,541
through their friendship

73
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,958
Jung gained unprecedented access to eastern

74
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,625
philosophical texts marking a turning point

75
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,291
in his understanding of the psyche

76
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,208
this meeting marked a turning point for Jung

77
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:35,541
from 1909 to 1914 he immersed himself in eastern texts

78
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:39,041
spending three hours each morning studying Sanskrit

79
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,500
his letters from this period

80
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,083
reveal an increasing fascination

81
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,625
with Buddhist concepts particularly

82
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,458
their parallels with his patients experiences

83
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,583
by 1920

84
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,750
Jung had accumulated one of Europe's most comprehensive

85
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,375
private collections of Buddhist texts

86
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,916
including rare Tibetan manuscripts

87
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,875
twenty five centuries earlier

88
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,875
in the flourishing Gangetic Plain of ancient India

89
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,666
a different revelation unfolded

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,583
Prince Siddhartha Gautama  after years of searching

91
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,666
discovered a profound truth under the Bodie Tree

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,625
his insight into no self wasn't merely philosophical

93
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,958
it stemmed from direct experience

94
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,416
in the Anatta-lakkhana Sutta he proclaimed

95
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,750
this pivotal moment occurred around 485 BCE

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,750
when the 35 year old Siddhartha attained enlightenment

97
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,416
within weeks

98
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:49,166
he delivered the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta at Sarnath

99
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,833
establishing the foundation of Buddhist thought

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,958
five years later his teaching of Anatta emerged

101
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,458
fully formed in the Anattalakkhana Sutta at Varanasi

102
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,083
the cultural exchange between east and west

103
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:07,041
accelerated dramatically during Jung's lifetime

104
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,625
as steamships and telegraphs connected continents

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,750
Buddhist texts reached Europe in unprecedented numbers

106
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,791
Jung's personal library in KÃ¼snacht

107
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,500
filled with Sanskrit and Pali translations

108
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,500
eastern commentaries and philosophical treatises

109
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,208
but Jung wasn't just a passive reader

110
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,458
his analytical psychology emerged

111
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,958
during a time of profound

112
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,166
global change

113
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,125
while treating patients in his Swiss practice

114
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,916
he noticed patterns that

115
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,625
eerily matched Buddhist descriptions of consciousness

116
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,291
in his clinical notes from 1925

117
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,583
he observed

118
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,166
this convergence wasn't coincidental

119
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,208
both Jung and Buddha

120
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,375
confronted fundamental questions about human suffering

121
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,666
and its roots in our sense of self

122
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:06,083
their methods differed Jung  through psychoanalysis

123
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,166
Buddha through meditation

124
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,000
but their investigations led to

125
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,500
complementary insights about consciousness

126
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,375
even more fascinating is how Jung's personal crisis

127
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,333
documented in his Red Book

128
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,500
mirrored Buddha's period of intense questioning

129
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,500
both men emerged from their ordeals

130
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,833
with revolutionary understanding

131
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,666
Jung reflected

132
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,625
yet their cultural contexts

133
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,958
shaped how they express these insights

134
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,708
while Buddha taught in the language of dharma

135
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,458
and dependent origination

136
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,708
Jung spoke of archetypes

137
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,416
and the collective unconscious

138
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,166
these different vocabularies

139
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,375
sometimes mask their shared understanding

140
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,208
what exactly did Jung mean by the self

141
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,291
in his groundbreaking work Aion

142
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,166
published in 1951

143
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,291
Jung presents the self as something far more profound

144
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,166
than our everyday personality

145
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,875
he writes the self is not only the center

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,875
but also the whole circumference

147
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,750
which embraces both conscious and unconscious

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,166
it is the center of this totality

149
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:36,000
just as the ego is the center of consciousness

150
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,583
for Jung the ego

151
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,666
our conscious identity

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,250
is merely the tip of an immense psychological iceberg

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,708
through his work with patients

154
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,375
he discovered that beneath our conscious awareness

155
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,708
lies a vast reservoir of psychological material

156
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,208
this wasn't just personal memories

157
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,750
or repressed thoughts

158
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,708
Jung found evidence of universal patterns

159
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,208
he called archetypes

160
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,416
shared across cultures and time periods

161
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,458
in his personal journals

162
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,208
Jung documented numerous cases

163
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:09,958
where patients

164
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,541
with no knowledge of eastern spirituality

165
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,583
spontaneously produced mandalas

166
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,208
circular symbols

167
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:21,041
that he recognized as representations of the self

168
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,291
one particularly striking case involved a businessman

169
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,000
who dreamed of a luminous crystal

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,666
at the bottom of a deep well

171
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,708
Jung noted without any knowledge of eastern thought

172
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:35,000
my patient had discovered the symbol of the self

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,041
that Buddhist texts describe as the diamond body

174
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,208
but Jung's concept of self wasn't static

175
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,208
in psychology and alchemy

176
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,958
he describes it as a process rather than a fixed entity

177
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,708
the self is not a static entity

178
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,958
but a dynamic process of wholeness

179
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,250
this process which he called individuation

180
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,333
involves integrating unconscious aspects of the psyche

181
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,041
into consciousness

182
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,000
through clinical observation

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Jung identified distinct stages

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,958
in this journey toward wholeness

185
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,666
patients first encountered their shadow

186
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,250
the rejected aspects of themselves

187
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,125
then came the anima or animus

188
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,125
their inner feminine or masculine counterparts

189
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,083
finally

190
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,500
they experienced what Jung termed self realization

191
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:28,000
a state remarkably similar to Buddhist enlightenment

192
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,500
Jung supported his theories with extensive research

193
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,916
into mythology religion and alchemy

194
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,000
in his clinical files

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,166
he recorded thousands of dreams and visions

196
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,416
that pointed to universal patterns in the human psyche

197
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,458
one patient's dream of a radiant center

198
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,875
surrounded by darkness

199
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,416
paralleled ancient Tibetan mandalas

200
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,000
despite the patient

201
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,541
having no exposure to Buddhist imagery

202
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,083
the self in Jung psychology

203
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,583
serves as both origin and destination

204
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,875
as he wrote in Memories

205
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,458
Dreams Reflections

206
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,000
yet this divine center

207
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,500
paradoxically contains all opposites

208
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,833
conscious and unconscious

209
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,916
good and evil spirit and matter

210
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,000
Jung's late writings reveal

211
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,500
an increasingly nuanced view of the self

212
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,708
one that began to bridge the gap with Buddhist thought

213
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,166
in his forward to D.T. Suzuki's work

214
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,541
he acknowledges

215
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,583
the Buddhist teaching of Anatta

216
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,000
or no self stands as

217
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,041
one of the most radical propositions in human thought

218
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,250
in the Anattalakkhana Sutta

219
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,208
his second discourse after Enlightenment

220
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,583
Buddha challenged

221
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,041
the prevailing notion of an unchanging soul

222
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,541
or self

223
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,166
modern Buddhist scholar Bhikkhu Bodhi explains

224
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,166
the Anatta doctrine

225
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,500
is not a mere philosophical opinion

226
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:22,208
but a strategy for seeing through the conceit of self

227
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,041
and thereby letting go of all attachment

228
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,625
this interpretation aligns with both classical

229
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,541
commentaries

230
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,208
and contemporary understanding of the teaching

231
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,958
to understand this profound teaching

232
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:40,250
we must first grasp what Buddha meant by self

233
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,375
in ancient India the dominant

234
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,500
Vedic tradition taught the existence of an eternal

235
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,541
unchanging soul called Atman

236
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,625
Buddha's direct experience

237
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,958
through meditation revealed something different

238
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,791
a dynamic flow of experience with no permanent center

239
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,250
the Buddha used a practical method

240
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,958
to demonstrate this truth

241
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,583
he broke down human experience into five aggregates

242
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,083
or skandhas

243
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,291
form feeling perception

244
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,500
mental formations and consciousness

245
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,500
through systematic examination

246
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,375
he showed that none of these components

247
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:23,291
alone or combined constitutes a permanent self

248
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,000
consider a simple example

249
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,458
Buddha often used a chariot

250
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,583
when we disassemble a chariot

251
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,333
into its wheels axle

252
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,208
body and reins

253
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,625
where is the chariotness

254
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:41,041
it exists only as a convenient label for these parts

255
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,291
working together

256
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:47,250
similarly our sense of self is a useful convention

257
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,791
but under scrutiny we find only changing processes

258
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,625
in the MilindapaÃ±ha an ancient Buddhist text

259
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,250
we find a fascinating dialogue between the monk

260
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,750
Nagasena and King Melinda

261
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:05,875
when the king asks Nagasana his name the monk responds

262
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,875
Nagasena is just a designation

263
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,708
a term a concept

264
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,291
a name

265
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,875
no permanent person exists here

266
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,541
this perfectly captures Buddha's teaching on no self

267
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,958
the Visuddhimagga a cornerstone of Buddhist philosophy

268
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,375
presents another compelling perspective

269
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,541
through the metaphor of a lighting lamp

270
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,000
each flame appears continuous

271
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,625
yet is never the same from moment to moment

272
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,541
the text states the being of the present moment lives

273
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,833
but does not proceed to the next moment

274
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,000
this illustrates how our

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,416
apparent continuity of self exists

276
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,916
without requiring a permanent essence

277
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,750
the subtlety of this teaching becomes clear

278
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,500
in the Buddha's careful language

279
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,000
he never claimed there is no self

280
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,666
such a statement would simply replace one fixed view

281
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,750
with another

282
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,625
instead

283
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,875
he demonstrated that what we take to be a self

284
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,208
cannot be found when we look deeply

285
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,000
as recorded in the Samyutta Nikaya

286
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,708
this understanding transforms

287
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,791
our relationship with experience

288
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,333
the Dhammapada captures this shift

289
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,416
all conditioned things are impermanent

290
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,583
when one sees this with wisdom

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,833
one turns away from suffering

292
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,625
rather than creating despair

293
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,458
this insight liberates us from

294
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,791
the exhausting task of maintaining a fixed identity

295
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,875
the practice of seeing no self

296
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,875
appears throughout Buddhist traditions

297
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,916
Zen masters ask what was your original face

298
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,666
before your parents were born

299
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,333
Tibetan practitioners contemplate the question

300
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,791
who is it that thinks

301
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,166
these inquiries point directly to the experience

302
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,916
beyond our conceptual understanding of self

303
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,750
yet Buddha emphasized

304
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,291
that this teaching serves a practical purpose

305
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,125
the end of suffering

306
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,416
understanding no self naturally

307
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,583
dissolves our tendency to grasp and reject experience

308
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,916
based on a fictional fixed identity

309
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,708
what remains is the natural flow of phenomena

310
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,750
und distorted by the illusion of a permanent self

311
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,083
this inside carries profound implications

312
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,541
by seeing through the illusion of a fixed self

313
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:45,416
we naturally develop compassion for all beings

314
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,500
who share this fundamental condition

315
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,291
the teaching doesn't negate conventional identity

316
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,666
but reveals its constructed nature

317
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,458
allowing us to engage with life more freely

318
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,583
and authentically

319
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,625
at first glance Jung's concept of the self

320
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:09,125
and Buddha's teaching of no self appear irreconcilable

321
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,916
yet a deeper examination reveals surprising convergence

322
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,458
in his later writings

323
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,083
Jung himself hinted at this connection

324
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,500
the self

325
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
as a unifying principle within the human psyche

326
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,166
occupies the center of potential wholeness

327
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,458
at its core it's both everything and nothing

328
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,083
just as the Buddhists maintain

329
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,125
this apparent paradox resolves

330
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,916
when we understand both perspectives more deeply

331
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,500
Jung's clinical work revealed that

332
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,833
the more his patients approached self realization

333
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,000
the more their rigid ego structures dissolved

334
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,833
in his personal notes from 1938

335
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,000
he observed the experience of the self

336
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,083
brings a dissolution of the identity

337
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,041
we've always taken for granted

338
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,583
here we find the clearest convergence between

339
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,875
Jung and Buddha Jung

340
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,666
self realization and Buddha's liberation

341
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,250
both point to transcending the ego's limitations

342
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,291
while their languages differ

343
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,791
both discovered that freedom comes through releasing

344
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,375
rigid self concepts not strengthening them

345
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,583
what unites these perspectives

346
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,375
is their shared recognition

347
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:27,833
of the ego as both necessary and illusory

348
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,500
Jung believed that

349
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,416
the ego serves as a gateway to greater wholeness

350
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,791
just as Buddha acknowledged that conventional identity

351
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,916
is a useful tool for navigating daily life

352
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,291
yet both traditions

353
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,875
ultimately guide us beyond this limited sense of self

354
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,833
revealing a deeper reality

355
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,041
that transcends individuality

356
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,416
the Tibetan Book of the dead

357
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,708
particularly fascinated Jung

358
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:53,208
who wrote

359
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,500
extensive commentary on its psychological significance

360
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,625
he noted how its description of consciousness

361
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,416
dissolving into clear light

362
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,708
paralleled his patients experiences of ego dissolution

363
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,625
during profound psychological transformation

364
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,416
what Buddhism calls emptiness

365
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,291
he wrote

366
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:17,000
we might call the ultimate ground of psychic reality

367
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,541
a revealing example comes from Jung's own practice

368
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,458
during his confrontation with the unconscious

369
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,666
documented in the Red Book

370
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,541
Jung experienced states remarkably

371
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,333
similar to Buddhist descriptions of emptiness

372
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,083
he describes moments where his usual sense of self

373
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,458
completely dissolved

374
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,416
revealing what he called the pleroma

375
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,833
a state beyond all distinctions

376
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,916
both traditions recognize that our usual sense of self

377
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,416
causes suffering

378
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,291
while Buddhism directly points to the illusion of self

379
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,500
Jung's approach guides people through

380
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,916
the psychological structures that maintain this

381
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:00,916
illusion as he noted in a 1939 seminar

382
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:04,416
individualation leads to a paradoxical result

383
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,708
the more one becomes oneself

384
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:10,500
the more one realizes the universal quality of being

385
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,291
the role of suffering also bridges their teachings

386
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,041
for Buddha

387
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,916
suffering arises from clinging to impermanent phenomena

388
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,750
including the self

389
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,416
Jung similarly

390
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,375
observed that

391
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,708
psychological distress often stems from an inability

392
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,041
to integrate the unconscious

393
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,166
leading to fragmented identities

394
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,541
both approaches emphasize a path of transformation

395
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,000
Buddha through the Eightfold Path

396
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,083
and Jung through individualation

397
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,250
that resolves this inner tension

398
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,125
and fosters a deeper harmony

399
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,625
Jung's concept of archetypes offers another bridge

400
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,625
these universal patterns exist

401
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,083
independent of any individual ego

402
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,750
suggesting a reality beyond personal identity

403
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,875
similarly Buddhist teachings speak of dharma

404
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,333
the underlying patterns of reality that exist

405
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,750
whether or not we recognize them

406
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,083
the therapeutic practices of both traditions

407
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,458
often align in surprising ways

408
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,083
Jung's active imagination

409
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,875
parallels certain Buddhist visualization practices

410
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:21,250
both methods aim to loosen rigid ego structures

411
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,791
and allow deeper wisdom to emerge

412
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,083
as Jung wrote after studying Buddhist texts

413
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,750
the east has taught me another wider

414
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,416
more profound and higher understanding

415
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,583
understanding through life

416
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,291
this convergence becomes particularly clear

417
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,083
in their shared emphasis on direct experience

418
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,166
both Buddha and Jung insisted that intellectual

419
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,375
understanding alone

420
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,666
cannot transform consciousness

421
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,041
Jung stated

422
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,791
the patient must experience something that grips him

423
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,833
then he can learn to overcome his former attitudes

424
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:57,875
in the end

425
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,750
both Jung and Buddha teach that transformation begins

426
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,583
by facing ourselves not as static entities

427
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,625
but as fluid processes

428
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,000
through direct experience

429
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,375
in meditation analysis or daily reflection

430
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,083
we discover that freedom lies in

431
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,208
embracing the paradox of selfhood

432
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,291
it is both everything and nothing

433
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,750
an illusion and a gateway to wholeness

434
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
the synthesis of Jung psychology and Buddhist wisdom

435
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,125
offers profound tools for personal transformation

436
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,791
a vivid example appears in contemporary

437
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,500
therapeutic practices

438
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,500
where clinicians integrate both perspectives

439
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,083
one therapist documented a patient's breakthrough

440
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,833
when Sarah stopped trying to fix herself

441
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,250
and began to observe its fluid nature

442
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,791
her anxiety decreased dramatically

443
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
she discovered what Jung called the self

444
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,833
and Buddha pointed to as no self

445
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,583
not by seeking but by letting go

446
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,583
this integration manifests in concrete practices

447
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,750
take dream work for instance

448
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,083
Jung's approach to dreams

449
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,291
encourages us to engage with dream figures

450
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,208
as aspects of our psyche

451
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,958
when combined with Buddhist mindfulness

452
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:19,000
this practice becomes even more powerful

453
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,750
rather than identifying with

454
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,583
or rejecting dream experiences

455
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:27,250
we learn to observe them with spacious awareness

456
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,125
contemplative psychotherapy

457
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,708
demonstrates another practical application

458
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,208
here Jung's understanding of the shadow

459
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,416
meets Buddhist techniques

460
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,583
for working with difficult emotions

461
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,375
patients learn to welcome

462
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,333
all aspects of their experience

463
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,250
without identifying with them

464
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,375
one psychiatrist noted

465
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,791
when we stop fighting against parts of ourselves

466
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,458
integration happens naturally

467
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,791
the practice of active imagination

468
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,833
central to Jungian psychology

469
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:01,750
takes on new depth when paired with Buddhist insights

470
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,375
instead of seeking a stronger self

471
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,166
practitioners learn to move

472
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,208
fluidly between different aspects

473
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,083
of psyche

474
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:12,375
a long term meditator described this experience

475
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,500
I used to think I needed to become someone better

476
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:19,333
now I see there's no fixed self to improve

477
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,000
just an unfolding process to trust

478
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,125
this combined approach

479
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,916
particularly helps with chronic identity struggles

480
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,083
Jung's map of psychological development

481
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,875
enriched by Buddhist wisdom

482
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:32,708
shows how

483
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:35,750
our suffering often stems from rigid self concepts

484
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,250
one case study describes a businessman

485
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,375
who transformed his workaholism

486
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,000
understanding both perspectives

487
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,166
helped him see his drive for success

488
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,916
as neither self nor not self

489
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:51,000
but as a pattern he could relate to more wisely

490
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,791
even relationships benefit from this integrated

491
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:55,875
understanding

492
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,625
when we grasp neither at permanent selfhood

493
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,916
nor deny our relative existence

494
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,750
we can engage more authentically with others

495
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,208
a couple's therapist reported

496
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:06,833
partners

497
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:09,208
who understand both Jung and Buddha's insights

498
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,916
fight less about who's right

499
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,791
and connect more deeply with each other's

500
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,000
essential nature

501
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:18,500
beyond individual transformation and relationships

502
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,833
these insights have found their way into broader

503
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:24,833
social contacts in organizational settings

504
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:27,583
this synthesis has borne fruit

505
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,250
leadership programs incorporating both perspectives

506
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,166
help executives navigate power

507
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,791
without becoming inflated

508
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:35,916
or depleted

509
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,333
as one CEO reflected

510
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:43,291
understanding the self as both center and no center

511
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:44,208
paradoxically

512
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:47,625
made me both more effective and more humble

513
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:50,625
therapists and practitioners

514
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:53,333
keep finding fresh ways to blend these approaches

515
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:56,625
the key lies not in choosing between Jung and Buddha

516
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,583
but in allowing both perspectives to illuminate

517
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,250
our path toward wholeness

518
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:06,916
what began as a seeming contradiction

519
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:08,833
between Jung's integrated self

520
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:10,375
and Buddha's no self

521
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,625
reveals itself as a profound complimentary

522
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:16,541
their wisdom separated by millennia

523
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:17,958
yet united in purpose

524
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:21,208
offers us a richer understanding of human consciousness

525
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:23,791
and the path to psychological freedom

526
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,583
Jung wrote near the end of his life

527
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,625
the goal of eastern religious practice is

528
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:31,041
the same as that of western psychology

529
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:33,583
the shifting of the center of gravity

530
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:36,125
from the ego to the self

531
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,166
Buddha express the same truth through different words

532
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,833
like a water bubble like a mirage

533
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:48,041
one who regards the world in this way

534
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,458
death does not find

535
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:55,500
both remind us that our suffering stems

536
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,666
not from having or lacking a self

537
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:00,666
but from how we relate to our experience

538
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:04,000
by loosening our grip on fixed identity

539
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:08,500
we can embrace life with greater wisdom and compassion

540
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,833
Jung called this wholeness

541
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,625
Buddha termed it liberation

542
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:16,958
both paths lead to the same universal truth

543
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,416
freedom lies in

544
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:21,000
seeing beyond the illusion of separation

545
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,166
like the two wings of a bird

546
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,000
Jung's depth

547
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,500
psychology and Buddhist teachings work together

548
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,500
showing us that our struggles with identity

549
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:33,500
can become gateways to profound wisdom

550
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:39,000
now I leave you with a question to reflect on

551
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,500
what lies beyond the story you tell yourself

552
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,833
about who you are?
