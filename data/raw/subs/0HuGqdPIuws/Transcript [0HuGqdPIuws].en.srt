from far and wide think of his him as

35

the Tony Robins of ancient India minus

36
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,560
the fir walking Alara taught sidartha

37
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,320
the art of deep concentration known as

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,360
Janna in p a state of deep mental

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,079
absorption where the Mind becomes still

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,439
and

41
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,320
focused this wasn't your average close

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,640
your eyes and think happy thoughts

43
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,240
meditation alara's technique allowed

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,640
practitioners to reach the realm of

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,759
nothingness a state of consciousness so

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,560
profound it made your typical Daydream

47
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,600
look like a kid's coloring book alara's

48
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,880
teaching gave sidartha the ability to

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,280
enter these profound meditative states

50
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,440
with intense focus and Clarity where the

51
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,479
mind could become completely still

52
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,479
absorbed in deep

53
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,360
concentration however alara's approach

54
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,560
focused primarily on mental discipline

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,599
and achieving these Altered States Of

56
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,040
Consciousness rather than addressing the

57
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,080
deeper existential questions sidartha

58
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,959
was wrestling with imagine sidartha

59
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,599
cross-legged eyes closed his mind

60
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,560
becoming still as a mirror-like lake

61
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,160
under alara's guidance he learned to

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,680
peel away layers of thought until

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,360
reaching a state of pure awareness it

64
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,360
was groundbreaking stuff for the young

65
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,000
Seeker like discovering you can change

66
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,959
the channel on reality it was like

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,680
sidartha took the red pill of meditation

68
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,280
seeing How Deep The Rabbit Hole of

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,280
Consciousness goes when sidartha

70
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:59,400
mastered the technique Alara reportedly

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:03,239
said to him your mind gatama is like a

72
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,239
polished gem clear unblemished and

73
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,239
capable of reflecting the deepest truths

74
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,640
you have achieved what many seek but few

75
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:15,000
attain talk about a five-star

76
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,480
review but here's where things get

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
interesting despite this High Praise

78
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,959
something nagged at sidartha this state

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,879
of nothingness impressive as it was

80
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,319
didn't answer his fundamental questions

81
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,000
about suffering and

82
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,000
Liberation it was like mastering a skill

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,519
without understanding the bigger

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,959
picture alara's teachings showed him how

85
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,599
to control the mind but not how to free

86
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,000
it completely from

87
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,360
suffering but sidartha wasn't satisfied

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,560
even after mastering alara's teachings

89
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,319
the key to Liberation still eluded him

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,400
in a bold move that would change the

91
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,680
course of his journey sidartha thanked

92
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,400
arara for the lessons and decided to

93
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,760
walk away in search of deeper

94
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,680
answers it was a crucial moment sidartha

95
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,360
realized that while deep concentration

96
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,360
was valuable it alone wasn't the key to

97
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,000
ultimate

98
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,280
truth sometimes you've got to know when

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
to fold them and when to walk away even

100
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,000
in the spiritual

101
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,639
Casino alara's influence on Buddhism

102
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,239
massive the Janna sidartha learned

103
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,079
became an integral part of Buddhist

104
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,560
practice but the Buddha would later

105
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,440
teach them as tools not ends in

106
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,600
themselves a stepping stone to deeper

107
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,520
insights it's like learning to make the

108
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,160
perfect pizza dough only to realize

109
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,280
you're actually after the secret sauce

110
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,280
of

111
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,320
Enlightenment after parting ways with

112
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,280
Alara Kalama sidartha sought out udaka

113
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,160
raputa a teacher known for his Mastery

114
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,080
of even more advanced meditative States

115
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,479
uda's ashram buzzed with an air of

116
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,800
mystery and profound spiritual

117
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:56,639
exploration it was like the Hogwarts of

118
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,280
meditation minus the flying broomsticks

119
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,440
while Alara had taught sidartha how to

120
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,880
focus and control the mind uda's

121
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,039
teachings went even further exploring

122
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,600
more subtle and refined States Of

123
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,120
Consciousness UDA introduced sidartha to

124
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,759
a state beyond the realm of nothingness

125
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,479
the realm of neither perception nor

126
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,520
non-perception if that sounds

127
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,319
mind-bending it's because it is this

128
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,280
state pushed the very limits of human

129
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,520
consciousness teetering on the edge of

130
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,240
experience itself it's like trying to

131
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,639
taste the color n or smell silence wrap

132
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,639
your mind around

133
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,240
that under uda's guidance sidartha

134
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,639
learned to refine his awareness to an

135
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,319
incredibly subtle degree it was like

136
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,560
tuning a radio to pick up the faintest

137
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,000
signal from the cosmos or trying to hear

138
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,039
a pin drop in a

139
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,639
library on the

140
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:50,520
moon udaka impressed by sidartha Swift

141
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,800
progress reportedly told him your mind

142
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,479
young Seeker is like the vast Sky

143
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,919
boundless and clear you've reached a

144
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,759
pinnacle few have glimpsed stay and

145
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,479
teach alongside IDE me for you have

146
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,880
matched my understanding talk about a

147
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:09,039
job offer you don't get every day but

148
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,560
sidartha while grateful felt a familiar

149
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,639
restlessness despite these advancements

150
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,759
sidartha realized that even this Ultra

151
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,199
refined State of Consciousness as

152
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,360
extraordinary as it was didn't address

153
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:25,160
the fundamental problems of existence

154
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,440
birth aging death and

155
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,919
suffering while Alara had shown him how

156
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,759
to enter deep states of concentration

157
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,759
and udaka had revealed even more

158
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,599
profound meditative Realms neither path

159
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,280
provided the Ultimate answers to Life's

160
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,000
biggest questions it became clear that

161
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,080
even these extraordinary states were not

162
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,360
the end goal but part of the journey in

163
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,240
a pivotal moment sedara realized that

164
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,120
even this rarified state was still

165
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,120
within the realm of conditioned

166
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,960
existence it wasn't the ultimate

167
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,680
Liberation he sought with respect and

168
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,240
gratitude he Bid Farewell to aaka

169
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,440
determined to find a path Beyond even

170
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,879
this subtle

171
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,960
realm our boy sidartha was playing

172
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,560
spiritual Hopscotch and he wasn't about

173
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,440
to stop until he reached the cosmic

174
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,800
Finish Line oda's teachings weren't in

175
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,319
vain though they showed sidartha the

176
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,280
furthest reaches of concentrated

177
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,039
meditation and helped him understand the

178
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,720
limits of perception itself these

179
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,759
insights would later inform the Buddha's

180
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,919
teachings on the nature of Consciousness

181
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,039
and the path to True

182
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:28,800
Liberation it's like learning to build a

183
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,879
rocket ship not because you want to go

184
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,240
to the Moon but because you're aiming

185
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,240
for the

186
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:39,800
Stars while sidartha never directly

187
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,879
studied under mahavira their paths and

188
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,479
ideas intersected in fascinating ways

189
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,520
mahavira the founder of jism was

190
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,759
revolutionizing spiritual practice in

191
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,199
Ancient India at the same time sidartha

192
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,400
was on his quest think of him as the

193
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,560
Steve Jobs of spirituality if Steve Jobs

194
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,639
was into extreme minimalism and never

195
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,199
wearing clothes

196
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,599
mahavira's path was one of extreme

197
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,960
asceticism imagine a man who renounced

198
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:09,440
not just wealth and comfort but even

199
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,840
clothing mahavira believed that the path

200
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,080
to Liberation lay in strict nonviolence

201
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,560
and the complete eradication of karma

202
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,720
through severe austerities it's like

203
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,000
trying to win a cosmic game of Limbo by

204
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,960
seeing how low you can go sidartha

205
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,520
during his wandering years encountered

206
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,080
Jane monks and their practices although

207
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,240
mahavira and sidartha never met directly

208
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,360
Jane aestheticism had a strong influence

209
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,719
on the spiritual environment at the time

210
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,360
sidartha observed how Jen practitioners

211
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,399
pushed their bodies to the absolute

212
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,760
limit fasting for weeks meditating in

213
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:47,000
the scorching Sun even plucking out

214
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,600
their hair by The Roots the Jen approach

215
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,920
emphasized that Liberation lay an

216
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,640
extreme discipline over the body for a

217
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,200
while sidartha adopted similar practices

218
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,160
testing whether physical denial could

219
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:03,519
lead to ultimate truth a g monk once

220
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:06,360
told said artha the body is a vessel of

221
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,959
suffering only by breaking its hold can

222
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,959
we free the soul each moment of pain is

223
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:14,279
a step towards

224
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:17,480
Liberation it's like trying to escape a

225
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:21,079
prison by digging a tunnel with a spoon

226
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,800
painful slow and maybe not the best

227
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:25,959
approach for a Time sidartha embraced

228
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,760
this radical path pushing his body to

229
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:31,040
the brink of death through fasting and

230
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,160
extreme meditation but unlike mahavira

231
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,279
sidartha ultimately rejected this path

232
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,320
as too

233
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,920
extreme he realized that while these

234
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,880
practices could demonstrate control over

235
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,720
the body they did not provide freedom

236
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,560
from the cycle of suffering it turns out

237
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,200
starving yourself isn't the fast track

238
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,160
to Enlightenment who

239
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,600
knew yet mahavira's influence on

240
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,760
Buddhism is

241
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,680
undeniable the concept of ahimsa which

242
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,720
means nonviolence and respect for all

243
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,360
living things became a corner Stone of

244
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,000
Buddhist ethics the idea that our

245
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,800
actions have consequences Karma the

246
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,120
universal law of cause and effect became

247
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,720
Central to both jism and Buddhism it's

248
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,480
like mahavira and sidartha were

249
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,600
spiritual DJs mixing similar tracks but

250
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,760
producing very different Tunes Sara's

251
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,360
encounter with giant ideas led him to a

252
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,720
crucial realization the middle way

253
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,920
between Indulgence and extreme

254
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,560
asceticism he saw that torturing the

255
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,399
body didn't Liberate the mind mind this

256
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,440
Insight was key in shaping the Buddhist

257
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,519
path of moderation and

258
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,760
mindfulness sometimes the secret to life

259
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,760
isn't going to extremes it's finding

260
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,850
that sweet spot in the middle like the

261
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,079
perfect bite of a

262
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,240
[Music]

263
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:50,480
sandwich let's turn our attention to

264
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,720
capila the OG of dualism this guy never

265
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,839
met sidartha directly but his ideas were

266
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,959
like a philosophical earworm in Ancient

267
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:01,920
India impossible to ignore capila the

268
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,680
found of the Samia School of philosophy

269
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,000
proposed a radical idea the universe

270
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:11,120
consists of two fundamental

271
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,160
realities prreti or the physical world

272
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,279
nature or matter and

273
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,680
perusia which refers to Pure

274
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,279
Consciousness or

275
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,600
Spirit imagine a world split into the

276
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,040
dancer and the dance forever intertwined

277
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,680
yet fundamentally separate it's like

278
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,839
trying to separate the Netflix from the

279
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,000
chill

280
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,360
technically possible but where's the fun

281
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,920
in

282
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,480
that this dualistic view challenged

283
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,959
prevailing Notions of a single unified

284
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,720
reality it suggested that our suffering

285
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,000
stems from confusing these two

286
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,360
principles mistaking the changes of the

287
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,279
material world prti for the nature of

288
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,440
our true unchanging Consciousness

289
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,120
perusia it's like getting upset when

290
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,240
your favorite character dies in a TV

291
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,720
show you're not the character you're the

292
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,959
Watcher sidartha never studied directly

293
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,440
under capila but the Samia school's

294
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,200
ideas were influential in the

295
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,800
philosophical debates of his time a

296
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,639
Wandering philosopher echoing kila's

297
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,360
teachings once told

298
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:17,279
sidartha see the world as a grand play

299
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,480
Young Seeker you are the Silent Witness

300
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,279
not the actor caught in the drama

301
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,959
Liberation comes from recognizing this

302
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,079
eternal

303
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,720
separation imagine being told you're not

304
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:32,079
the star of your own life story but the

305
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:35,279
audience talk about an existential plot

306
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,839
twist sidartha grappled with these ideas

307
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,120
they offered a compelling explanation

308
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,000
for The Human Condition and a potential

309
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,480
path to Freedom the concept of detached

310
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,720
observation would later influence

311
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,800
Buddhist mindfulness practices like

312
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,480
observing your thoughts and emotions

313
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,800
without identifying with them it's like

314
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,079
capila handed sidartha the spiritual

315
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,240
equivalent of 3D glasses suddenly

316
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,519
everything looked

317
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,399
different however since dartha

318
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,760
ultimately diverged from kila's strict

319
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,720
dualism he saw that while distinguishing

320
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,399
between awareness and its objects was

321
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,600
useful true Liberation comes from

322
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:12,959
understanding their interdependence not

323
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,360
their absolute

324
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,800
separation it's like realizing that

325
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,880
while the ocean is different from the

326
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,399
waves you can't have one without the

327
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,360
other kila's influence can be seen in

328
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,279
buddhism's analytical approach to

329
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,360
understanding reality the Buddhist

330
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:32,680
concept of namarupa meaning

331
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,240
name and form Echoes samia's dualism but

332
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,279
with a crucial

333
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,519
difference Buddhism sees name mental

334
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:43,279
aspects and form physical aspects as

335
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,440
interconnected parts of experience not

336
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,600
separate

337
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,120
realities sidartha took capa's idea and

338
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,720
gave it a remix turning philosophical

339
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,680
heavy metal into spiritual Jazz this

340
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,240
encounter with samya philosophy

341
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,639
sharpened Sara's analytical skills and

342
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,000
deepened his understanding of the

343
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,279
mindbody

344
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,880
relationship it set the stage for his

345
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:09,120
own nuanced view of reality which would

346
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,920
become a Cornerstone of Buddhist

347
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,279
philosophy sometimes you need to learn

348
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,100
the rules before you can break them and

349
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,079
break them sidartha

00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:21,040
[Music]

351
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,040
did now let's talk about yaj navalia the

352
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,399
OG spiritual Rebel this guy predated

353
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,160
sidartha by several centuries but his

354
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,800
ideas were like a philosophical Time

355
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,560
Bomb just waiting to explode in

356
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,680
sidarthur's

357
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,279
mind yaj navalia was one of the most

358
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,399
prominent figures in the aphotic

359
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:41,279
tradition which focused on seeking the

360
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,680
Ultimate Reality Brahman and

361
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:47,160
understanding the nature of the self

362
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,440
Atman yajia boldly challenged the rigid

363
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,959
Orthodoxy of his time proposing that

364
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,440
true understanding comes not from

365
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,759
rituals or scriptures but from direct

366
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,279
insight into the nature of self and

367
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,759
reality imagine a man standing before a

368
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,040
gathering of Scholars

369
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,600
boldly declaring that their cherished

370
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,600
beliefs might be missing the Mark it's

371
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,399
like walking into a Star Wars convention

372
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,120
and suggesting that maybe just maybe

373
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,000
Star Trek is

374
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,680
better

375
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,680
scandalous in one famous debate yaj

376
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,680
navalia reportedly said the self is not

377
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,000
this not that it cannot be grasped by

378
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,040
thought yet it is that by which thought

379
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,240
is known it is the Unseen Seer the

380
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,000
unheard hearer the unknown

381
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,600
try putting that on a bumper

382
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,920
sticker this idea of an ineffable

383
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,920
experiential truth Beyond conceptual

384
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,720
understanding deeply resonated with the

385
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,160
Indian spiritual tradition it set the

386
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,959
stage for seda's own emphasis on Direct

387
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,120
experience over Blind Faith or

388
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,360
intellectual

389
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,880
speculation it's like yaj navalia was

390
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,600
saying don't just read the menu taste

391
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,639
the food although yavalia lived

392
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,800
centuries before sidhartha the

393
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:02,279
upanishadic tradition he shape laid the

394
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,000
groundwork for some of sidharth's key

395
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:07,120
insights the upanishads with their focus

396
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,759
on the nature of Consciousness and the

397
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,600
Ultimate Reality were philosophical

398
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,600
challenges that sidartha would wrestle

399
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,399
with on his path to

400
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,120
Enlightenment the concept of Atman the

401
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,120
Eternal self and its relation to Brahman

402
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,399
the Ultimate Reality was a puzzle

403
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,120
sidartha engaged with

404
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:28,120
deeply however sartha eventually

405
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,680
rejected the notion of an eternal

406
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,639
unchanging self Atman in favor of his

407
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,040
revolutionary teaching of anata which

408
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,319
means

409
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,759
non-self the idea that there is no

410
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:44,120
permanent unchanging Essence in living

411
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,000
beings while the upanishad sought to

412
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,120
identify a Transcendent permanent self

413
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,880
sidartha realized that true Liberation

414
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,000
came from seeing the impermanent

415
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,040
everchanging nature of all things

416
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,800
including the self it's like yaj navalia

417
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,120
handed sidartha a Rubik's cube of the

418
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,000
Soul Tri to solve but oh so satisfying

419
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,520
when you

420
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,480
do while sidartha diverged from the

421
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,839
upano view of the self yaj Nalia's

422
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,439
method of rigorous inquiry and emphasis

423
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,880
on Direct realization became Central to

424
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,280
the Buddhist approach the Buddha's

425
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,959
famous injunction to be a lamp unto

426
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,400
yourself Echoes yaj Nalia's call for

427
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,319
personal investigation of truth it's

428
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,520
like yaj navalia was the spiritual

429
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,360
equivalent of your cool Uncle who tells

430
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,400
you to question everything even him

431
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,400
yajin Nalia's Legacy in Buddhism can be

432
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,240
seen in the emphasis on meditation and

433
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,640
introspection as means of understanding

434
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,400
reality his questioning Spirit lives on

435
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,039
in the Buddha's encouragement to test

436
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,720
and verify teachings through one's own

437
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,559
experience in a way yajnavalkya gave

438
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,000
sartha permission to think outside the

439
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,000
box and boy did he run with

440
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,440
it all right folks we've reached the

441
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,360
main event the grand finale the

442
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,960
spiritual knockout punch Buddha's

443
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,039
breakthrough picture sidartha now in his

444
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,640
early 30s sitting beneath the bod tree

445
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,880
he's absorbed the wisdom of India's

446
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,960
greatest sages pushed his body to its

447
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,240
limits and explored the furthest reaches

448
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,600
of Consciousness yet the ultimate truth

449
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,960
still eludes him it's like he's played

450
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,760
every level of the spiritual video game

451
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,919
but the final boss just won't go

452
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,480
down in this moment sidartha makes a

453
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:32,280
radical decision in instead of looking

454
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,840
outward to teachers or inward to extreme

455
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:38,760
states of mind he simply observes

456
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:41,640
reality as it is he watches his breath

457
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,400
notices Sensations in his body and sees

458
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,039
thoughts arise and pass away it's like

459
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,559
he discovered that the ultimate cheat

460
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:51,200
code was simply to be here now as the

461
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:53,039
night deepens sidharth's awareness

462
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,080
sharpens he begins to see the

463
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,760
interconnected nature of all

464
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:01,240
things the boundaries between self and

465
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:04,240
other mind body start to

466
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,760
dissolve in this Clarity he utters words

467
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,039
that would echo through

468
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,679
history Wonder of Wonders all beings are

469
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,000
already enlightened yet they don't

470
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,200
realize it they chase after fleeting

471
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,960
pleasures and run from imagined fears

472
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,480
failing to see the radiant awareness

473
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,120
that's always

474
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,039
present with this Insight sidartha

475
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,400
becomes the Buddha the awakened one he

476
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:28,919
realizes that the truth he sought isn't

477
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,640
found in escaping the world or in losing

478
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,320
oneself in Altered States it's in fully

479
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,000
embracing and understanding the nature

480
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,320
of reality itself it's like he spent

481
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,600
years searching for his glasses only to

482
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,559
realize they were on his head the whole

483
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,880
time the Buddha's breakthrough

484
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,720
synthesizes and transcends the teachings

485
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,679
of his

486
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,440
predecessors from arara and udaka he

487
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,280
keeps the practice of meditation but

488
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,600
reframes it as a tool for insight not an

489
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,400
end in

490
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,919
itself for mahavira he retains the

491
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,320
emphasis on ethics but rejects extreme

492
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,880
asceticism capa's analytical approach

493
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,440
finds new expression in the Buddha's

494
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:09,120
detailed examination of experience and

495
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,880
yavalia emphasis on Direct realization

496
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,400
becomes Central to the Buddhist path but

497
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,120
the Buddha goes beyond all of these his

498
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,840
middleway avoids the extremes of

499
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,840
self-indulgence and self-denial the

500
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,679
middleway became the One path to rule

501
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,640
them all guiding Seekers through the

502
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,919
spiritual landscape of ancient India his

503
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,240
teaching of non-self challenges both the

504
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,559
materialist and eternalist views of his

505
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,120
time and His Four Noble Truths offer a

506
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:37,440
pragmatic approach to addressing

507
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,440
suffering that's neither fatalistic nor

508
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,200
overly

509
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,960
optimistic it's like he took all the

510
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,159
ingredients his teachers gave him and

511
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,720
cooked up a completely new dish

512
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,000
Enlightenment

513
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,120
surprise in this breakthrough the

514
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,880
wandering Seeker sidartha fulfills his

515
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,640
quest becoming the

516
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,720
Buddha and in doing so he opens a path

517
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,240
that countless others would follow

518
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,080
seeking their own breakthrough to

519
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,159
Lasting Peace and Freedom talk about a

520
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:07,320
plot twist the student becomes the

521
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:07,320
teacher and the rest as they say is

522
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,960
history all right truth Seekers we've

523
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,679
reached the end of our Whirlwind tour

524
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,760
through the Buddha spiritual

525
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,200
education let's bring it all back home

526
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:24,039
shall we these ancient sages Alara udaka

527
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,640
mahavira capila and yavalia might seem

528
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:29,120
like characters from a spiritual soap

529
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,440
opera set in a galaxy far far away but

530
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,159
their quest for understanding The Human

531
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,919
Condition that's as relevant today as a

532
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,279
smartphone at a dinner table think about

533
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:42,279
it don't we still grapple with the same

534
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:44,760
fundamental questions we seek peace in a

535
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:47,679
chaotic World yearn for meaning in our

536
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,600
lives and strive to understand our place

537
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,360
in the

538
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,600
universe the Buddha's Journey influenced

539
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,840
by these great thinkers offers us a road

540
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,840
map for our own

541
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,240
Explorations it's like they left us a

542
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,840
spiritual GPS mind is the annoying

543
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,919
recalculating voice but here's the

544
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,960
kicker the Buddha didn't just rehash old

545
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,080
ideas he took the best of what he

546
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,880
learned tested it against his own

547
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:15,159
experience and emerged with something

548
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:18,080
revolutionary his message the power to

549
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:20,640
find truth lies within each of us it's

550
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,080
like he was saying hey you've got the

551
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,200
answers inside you no need to download a

552
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,400
spiritual app so what does this mean for

553
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,919
you right here right now let's break it

554
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,520
down down first it's an invitation to

555
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,360
explore just as the Buddha learned from

556
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,679
various teachers we too can draw wisdom

557
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,960
from diverse sources whether it's

558
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,159
meditation philosophy science or art

559
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,320
remain open to insights wherever they

560
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:49,960
appear it's like being at a cosmic

561
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,000
Buffet try a little of everything but

562
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,240
maybe skip the month-old potato salad of

563
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,799
outdated

564
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,039
dogmas second it's a call to question

565
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,400
the Buddha didn't accept teachings BL L

566
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,240
and neither should we he learned to test

567
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,159
the limits of each teacher's wisdom and

568
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,520
move Beyond them when

569
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:09,840
necessary test ideas against your own

570
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,240
experience does it ring true does it

571
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,000
help reduce

572
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,240
suffering that's the litmus test it's

573
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,679
like being a spiritual mythbuster don't

574
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,480
just believe it test it finally it's an

575
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,880
encouragement to forge your own path the

576
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,799
Buddha's breakthrough came when he

577
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,200
stopped following others and trusted his

578
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:31,679
own Insight your breakthrough might come

579
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,320
in a similar way remember the Buddha

580
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,919
didn't find Enlightenment by scrolling

581
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,679
through Instagram or binge watching

582
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:40,720
Netflix though who knows maybe that's

583
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,640
your path remember the Buddha once said

584
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,520
do not go upon what has been acquired by

585
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,600
repeated hearing nor upon tradition nor

586
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,720
upon rumor nor upon what is in a

587
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:54,120
scripture nor upon surmise nor upon an

588
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,760
axiom nor upon specious reasoning nor

589
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,559
upon a bias towards a notion that has

590
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,400
been pondered over nor upon another

591
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,720
seeming ability nor upon the

592
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,320
consideration the monk is our

593
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,840
teacher when you yourselves know these

594
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,400
things are good these things are not

595
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,640
blamable these things are praised by the

596
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,240

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,720
them in other words don't just take my

600
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,480
word for it or anyone else's for that

601
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,760
matter the Buddha was basically saying

602
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,600

603
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:34,200
