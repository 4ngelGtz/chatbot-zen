2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,679
Hey, what's up wisdom seekers? Matt here

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,880
from Buddha's Wisdom and we're back with

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,960
another pure reading from the

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,359
Dharmapata.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,560
We've covered chapters 1- 10 and today

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,960
we're continuing with chapters 11- 15.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,480
These next five chapters cover aging,

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,720
the self, the world, the Buddha, and

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,320
happiness.

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,239
Like before, I'll read these verses

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,040
uninterrupted, letting this ancient

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,040
wisdom speak directly to you. You can

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,520
follow along with the text on screen or

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,360
simply listen. Peter will break down

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,680
everything we cover today in next week's

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,120
video, and I'll be back soon with more

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,280
chapters from this incredible text.

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,490
So, find a quiet spot, take a deep

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,709
breath, and let's begin.

21
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,709
[Music]

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,359
Chapter 11. Old age faces the reality of

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,120
aging and impermanence. The Buddha shows

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,119
us how understanding our mortality can

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,200
lead to greater wisdom and freedom.

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,520
What laughter, what pleasure is there

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,040
when the world is ablaze, shrouded in

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,360
darkness. Will you not seek a lamp?

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,040
Look upon this beautified body, a mass

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,080
of soores, a heaped up lump, diseased,

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,280
much thought of in which nothing lasts,

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,000
nothing persists.

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,520
This body is worn out, a nest of disease

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,520
and fragile. This foul mass breaks up

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,280
for death is the end of life.

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,439
What delight is there for one who sees

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,560
these dove-led bones that are cast away

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,960
like gourds in the autumn.

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,439
Of bones is this house made plastered

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,600
over with flesh and blood. Herein are

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,840
stored decay and death, pride and

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,759
hypocrisy.

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,399
Even the gorgeous royal chariots wear

44
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,320
out. And indeed this body too wears out,

45
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,719
but the dhamma of the good does not wear

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,960
out. Thus the good proclaim it to the

47
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,640
good.

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,280
The person of little learning grows old

49
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,000
like a bull. His bulk increases but his

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,520
wisdom does not grow.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,680
Through many a birth I wandered in

52
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,800
samsara, seeking but not finding the

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,160
builder of this house. Painful is birth

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,200
again and again.

55
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,360
Oh housebuilder, you are seen. You will

56
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,760
not build this house again. All your

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,160
rafters are broken. Your ridge pole is

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,400
shattered. The mind has attained the

59
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,400
unconditioned. Achieved is the end of

60
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,400
craving.

61
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,879
Those who have not practiced celibacy

62
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,200
and have not acquired wealth in their

63
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,360
youth perish like old herands in a lake

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,120
without fish.

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,200
Those

66
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,959
who have not practiced celibacy and have

67
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,360
not acquired wealth in their youth lie

68
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,070
like worn out arrows sighing over the

69
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,539
past.

70
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,539
[Music]

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,080
Chapter 12. Self teaches us about

72
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,680
personal responsibility and

73
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,200
self-control.

74
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,440
The Buddha shows that we are our own

75
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,480
refuge and that real change comes from

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,640
mastering ourselves.

77
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,120
If one holds oneself dear, one should

78
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,800
diligently watch oneself. Let the wise

79
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,000
person keep vigil during any of the

80
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,840
three watches.

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,840
One should first establish oneself in

82
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,720
what is proper. Then only should one

83
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,040
instruct others. Such a wise person will

84
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,040
not be reproached.

85
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,959
If one would do as one teaches others,

86
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,799
then being well controlled oneself, one

87
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,480
could control others. Indeed,

88
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,560
self-control is difficult.

89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,879
One is one's own refuge. Who else could

90
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,720
be the refuge? With oneself fully

91
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,200
controlled, one obtains a refuge which

92
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,200
is hard to obtain.

93
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,120
The evil done by oneself, born of

94
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,439
oneself, produced by oneself, crushes

95
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,680
the foolish one, as a diamond breaks a

96
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,680
hard gem.

97
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,280
One whose evil conduct is very extensive

98
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,840
spreads over oneself like a creeping

99
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,200
vine spreads over a tree. Easy

100
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,599
to do are things that are bad and

101
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:20,160
harmful to oneself. What is beneficial

102
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:22,000
and good is extremely difficult to do.

103
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,000
The foolish person who scorns the rule

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,840
of the venerable ones, of the noble ones

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
who live according to the dharma, and

106
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,680
follows false doctrine, fruits like the

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,680
bamboo, to its own destruction.

108
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,880
By oneself is evil done. By oneself is

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,960
one defiled. By oneself is evil left

110
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,919
undone. By oneself is one made pure.

111
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:50,040
Purity and impurity depended on oneself.

112
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,040
No one can purify another.

113
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,639
Let one not neglect one's own welfare

114
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,800
for the sake of anothers. However great,

115
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,240
clearly understanding one's own welfare,

116
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,240
let one be intent upon the good.

117
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,139
[Music]

118
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,840
Chapter 13. The world teaches us how to

119
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,479
live wisely while engaging with the

120
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,479
world around us. The Buddha shows us how

121
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,840
to see through appearances and avoid

122
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,160
being trapped by illusions.

123
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,320
Do not follow ignoble ways. Do not live

124
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,199
in heedlessness. Do not follow false

125
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:30,400
views. Do not be a friend of the world.

126
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,280
Arise. Do not be heedless.

127
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,039
Follow the righteous way of life. He who

128
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,320
practices righteousness lives happily

129
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,320
both in this world and the next.

130
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,759
Follow the righteous way of life. Do not

131
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,360
follow that which is unrighteous. The

132
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,880
righteous live happily both in this

133
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,960
world and the next.

134
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,280
One who regards this world as a bubble,

135
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,759
as a mirage, one who looks upon the

136
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,240
world in this way, the king of death

137
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,240
does not see.

138
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,280
Come, look at this world which is like a

139
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,840
decorated royal chariot. Here fools

140
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,840
flounder, but for the wise there is no

141
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,840
attachment.

142
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,039
Whoever having been heedless is heedless

143
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,160
no longer illuminates this world like

144
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,160
the moon when freed from clouds.

145
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,319
Whoever by a good deed covers the evil

146
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,280
done illuminates this world like the

147
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,280
moon when freed from clouds.

148
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,840
This world is blind. Few are those who

149
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:39,000
clearly see. Like birds escaping from

150
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,000
the net. Few go to realms of bliss.

151
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,120
Swans fly on the path of the sun. Men

152
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,360
with psychic powers travel through

153
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,360
space. The wise are led away from the

154
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,360
world. Having conquered Mara and his

155
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,360
host.

156
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,800
For a liar who has violated the one law,

157
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:59,360
who holds in scorn the world beyond,

158
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,120
there is no evil he will not do.

159
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,680
The miserly do not go to the realm of

160
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,400
the gods. Fools indeed do not praise

161
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,639
generosity, but the wise person delights

162
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,599
in generosity and through it becomes

163
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,599
blissful in the other world.

164
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,240
Better than soul sovereignty over the

165
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,080
earth, better than going to heaven,

166
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,639
better than even lordship over all the

167
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,960
worlds, is the super mundane fruition of

168
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,960
stream entrance.

[Music]

170
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,080
Chapter 14. The Buddha describes the

171
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,639
qualities of one who has reached

172
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,160
complete awakening. These verses show us

173
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,880
what becomes possible when someone

174
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,880
achieves full liberation.

175
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000
One whose victory cannot be turned into

176
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,560
defeat. Whom none of the conquered in

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,880
this world can follow. By what track can

178
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,000
you trace that Buddha, the awakened, the

179
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,000
omnisient, the trackless?

180
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,879
One who has no craving, the stream that

181
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,720
drags one along to trap him. By what

182
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,720
track can you trace that Buddha, the

183
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,720
awakened, the omnisient, the trackless?

184
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,080
Those wise ones who are devoted to

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,560
meditation, who delight in the calm of

186
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,919
renunciation, such mindful, perfect

187
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,919
Buddhas even the gods hold dear.

188
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,919
Hard is it to be born a human being.

189
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,000
Hard is the life of mortals. Hard is it

190
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,160
to gain access to the true dharma and

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,160
hard to encounter is the arising of the

192
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Buddhas.

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,039
To avoid all evil, to cultivate good and

194
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,599
to cleanse one's mind. This is the

195
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,599
teaching of the Buddhas.

196
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,000
Patient endurance is the supreme

197
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,880
austerity.

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,360
Nibbana is supreme. Say the Buddhas. He

199
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:52,120
is not a true monk who harms another nor

200
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,120
a true renunciate who oppresses others.

201
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,440
Not insulting, not harming. Restraint

202
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,519
according to the fundamental precepts.

203
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,320
Moderation in food, dwelling in

204
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:06,360
solitude, devotion to meditation. This

205
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,360
is the teaching of the Buddhas.

206
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,040
Not by a shower of gold coins can

207
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,880
sensual desires be satisfied. Sensual

208
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:18,240
desires are of little sweetness and much

209
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:20,000
pain. Knowing this, the wise man

210
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,399
finds no delight even in heavenly

211
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
pleasures. The disciple of the supreme

212
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,000
Buddha delights in the destruction of

213
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
craving.

214
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:34,080
Driven only by fear, men go for refuge

215
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,200
to many places, to hills, woods, groves,

216
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,200
trees, and shrines.

217
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,080
Such indeed is no safe refuge. Such is

218
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,920
not the refuge supreme. Not by resorting

219
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,080
to such a refuge is one released from

220
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,080
all suffering.

221
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,120
He who has gone for refuge to the

222
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,040
Buddha, the teaching and his order,

223
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,920
penetrates with transcendental wisdom

224
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,920
the four noble truths.

225
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,839
The suffering, the cause of suffering,

226
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,760
the sessation of suffering, and the

227
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,360
noble eight-fold path leading to the

228
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,560
sessation of suffering.

229
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,519
This indeed is the safe refuge. This is

230
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,760
the refuge supreme. Having gone to such

231
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,760
a refuge, one is released from all

232
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,760
suffering.

233
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,600
Hard to find is the thoroughbred man. He

234
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,760
is not born everywhere. Where such a

235
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,760
wise one is born, that clan thrives

236
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,760
happily.

237
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,440
Blessed is the birth of the Buddhas.

238
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,680
Blessed is the enunciation of the sacred

239
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,600
teaching. Blessed is the harmony and the

240
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,040
order. And blessed is the spiritual

241
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,040
pursuit of the united truth seeker.

242
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,560
He who pays homage to such as have

243
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,720
transcended all and crossed the flood,

244
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,360
whose passions are extinguished, and for

245
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,360
whom there is no more rebirth.

246
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,000
The merit gained by such homage cannot

247
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,000
be measured by anyone.

248
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,519
Chapter 15. Happiness reveals the

249
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,760
Buddha's teaching on true contentment.

250
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,839
These verses show us that real happiness

251
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,279
comes from inner peace rather than

252
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,360
external circumstances.

253
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,160
Let us live happily then, not hating

254
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:24,160
those who hate us. Among those who hate,

255
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,560
let us dwell free from hatred.

256
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,800
Let us live happily then, free from

257
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,640
ailments among the ailing. Among those

258
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,640
who are ailing, let us dwell free from

259
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,640
ailments.

260
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,800
Let us live happily then, free from

261
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,720
attachment among those who are attached.

262
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,480
Among those who are attached, let us

263
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,560
dwell free from attachment.

264
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,800
Let us live happily then, though we call

265
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,920
nothing our own. We shall be like the

266
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,920
bright gods feeding on happiness.

267
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,600
Victory breeds hatred for the conquered

268
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,880
is unhappy. He who has given up both

269
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,839
victory and defeat, he the contented is

270
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,480
happy.

271
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,440
There is no fire like greed, no crime

272
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,480
like hatred, no sorrow like separation,

273
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,480
no happiness like peace.

274
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,480
Health is the greatest gift, contentment

275
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,800
the greatest wealth, faithfulness the

276
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,120
best relationship. Nibbana is the

277
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,120
greatest happiness.

278
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,880
Having tasted the sweetness of solitude

279
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,200
and peace, one becomes free from fear

280
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,760
and sin, while drinking the sweetness of

281
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,760
the joy of truth.

282
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,360
It is good to see noble ones, to live

283
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,200
with them as always happiness. If one

284
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,839
does not see fools, one will be

285
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,839
continually happy.

286
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,000
Indeed, he who moves in the company of

287
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,079
fools grieavves for longing. Association

288
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,160
with fools is always painful, like

289
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,720
partnership with an enemy. But

290
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,440
association with the wise is joyful,

291
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,440
like meeting with kinfolk.

292
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,639
Therefore, one ought to follow the wise,

293
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,160
the intelligent, the learned, the much

294
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,920
enduring, the dutiful, the noble ones.

295
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,160
One ought to follow a good and wise

296
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,399
person as the moon follows the path of

297
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,399
the stars.

298
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,079
There you have it. Five more chapters

299
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,639
from the Dharmapata covering aging,

300
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,720
self-mastery, navigating the world,

301
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,920
understanding awakening, and finding

302
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,519
true happiness.

303
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,120
Peter will be back next week to break

304
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,800
down the deeper meanings and practical

305
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,360
applications of everything we covered

306
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,760
today. I'll be back soon with more

307
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,519
chapters from this incredible text.

308
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,480
We're only halfway through the complete

309
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,320
Dharmapata.

310
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,480
If any of these verses resonated with

311
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,519
you, drop a comment below and let me

312
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,839
know which one hit home.

313
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,279
This is Matt from Buddha's Wisdom.

314
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,839
Thanks for taking this journey through

315
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:04,360
these timeless teachings with me. Stay

316
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,360
curious. Stay wise.
