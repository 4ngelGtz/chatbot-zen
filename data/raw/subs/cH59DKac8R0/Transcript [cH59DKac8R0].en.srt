1
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:10,166
okay picture me trying to walk through a wall right now

2
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,791
ouch solid wall right

3
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:14,166
wrong

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,375
scientists just proved that this solid wall

5
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:19,208
and everything else around you

6
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,458
is basically a grand illusion

7
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,500
and guess who called this thousands of years ago

8
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,000
yep Buddha himself

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,625
was dropping quantum physics knowledge

10
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:29,875
while people were still figuring out

11
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,416
which berries wouldn't kill them

12
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:33,291
hey everyone

13
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,000
Matt here and I promise

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,958
I didn't hit my head too hard on that wall

15
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,291
today's revelation is going to mess with your brain

16
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,083
way more than any wall collision

17
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,333
remember last month when we talked about

18
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,500
Einstein's secret connection to Buddhism?

19
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,166
that was just the appetizer

20
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,666
today we're serving the main course

21
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:52,958
and trust me

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,958
reality itself is on the menu

23
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,083
see those tiny particles that make up everything

24
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,458
they're basically acting like my little sister

25
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,250
completely changing their behavior

26
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,875
the moment someone watches them

27
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:09,333
no joke actual scientists are scratching their heads

28
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,083
because particles

29
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,000
straight up decide to do different things

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,375
just because we're looking

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,208
Buddhist masters weren't just sitting under trees

32
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:17,375
looking peaceful

33
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,333
they were basically quantum physics prophets

34
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,541
describing this exact weird behavior

35
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,375
centuries before

36
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,875
we had microscopes powerful enough to see it

37
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,375
in the next few minutes you'll discover

38
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,875
why Einstein freaked out about these discoveries

39
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,000
why SchrÃ¶dinger

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,291
had to drag his poor cat into this mess

41
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:35,000
and

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,208
why these invisible particles prove that your mind is

43
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,541
basically a reality bending superpower

44
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,208
no I'm not quoting Doctor Strange

45
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:43,958
this is actual science

46
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:46,791
meeting ancient wisdom in the most incredible way

47
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,125
and now let me show you

48
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,625
the experiment that made Einstein lose his mind

49
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,666
imagine two identical particles

50
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,166
seemingly simple right

51
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:01,166
well what happens next is so bizarre

52
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,833
it made even Einstein himself say

53
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,250
what the quantum!

54
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,041
okay

55
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,458
he didn't exactly say that

56
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:10,791
but what you're about to see

57
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,500
made the world's greatest physicist

58
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,000
question everything he knew about reality

59
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:20,375
let's start with

60
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,833
the weirdest experiment in scientific history

61
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,208
the one that still makes

62
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,333
physicists wake up in a cold sweat

63
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,250
remember in the matrix

64
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,791
when Neo sees reality isn't actually real

65
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,875
well this experiment makes that look like a

66
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,083
kid's magic trick

67
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,791
imagine shooting tiny particles at a wall

68
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,416
with two slits in it behind the wall

69
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,958
there's a screen that shows where these particles land

70
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,583
now if I threw tennis balls at these slits

71
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,791
we'd get exactly what you'd expect

72
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,875
two neat strips where the balls went through

73
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,375
but when scientists did this with quantum particles

74
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,875
something impossible happened

75
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,000
instead of two strips

76
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,333
they got this weird striped pattern

77
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,375
like waves on a beach

78
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,916
when two ripples meet

79
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,500
they create these amazing interference patterns

80
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,875
you know when you drop two rocks in a pond

81
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,125
and the ripples cross each other

82
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,708
making that cool diamond shape

83
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,833
that's exactly what these particles were doing

84
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,000
except they were single particles

85
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,500
each particle went through both slits at the same time

86
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,416
and then interfered with itself

87
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,583
if you're thinking "that's not how reality works"

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,833
you're right

89
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,708
that's exactly what Einstein said

90
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,666
he was so disturbed by this randomness

91
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,416
in quantum mechanics that he famously declared

92
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,458
he believed there had to be some hidden rules

93
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,291
making everything predictable

94
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,500
in fact this experiment made him so uncomfortable

95
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,750
he spent years trying to prove it wrong

96
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,416
here's where it gets proper weird

97
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,333
scientists thought let's watch these particles

98
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,625
to see which slit they actually go through

99
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,833
and this is when reality broke

100
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,375
the moment they observed the particles

101
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,541
the pattern disappeared

102
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,791
just by watching

103
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,958
they changed how the particles behaved

104
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,125
consider the implications

105
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,750
these tiny particles know when we're watching them

106
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:25,958
well

107
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,250
it's not that these particles know in a conscious sense

108
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,166
but their behavior changes based on measurement

109
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,041
suggesting a fundamental link

110
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,208
between observation and reality

111
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:37,666
it's like reality

112
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:41,458
itself only decides what to do when someone's watching

113
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,875
just like those agents in the matrix

114
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,208
popping into existence when someone looks

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,833
and hey

116
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,375
if you're into how the matrix and Buddhism connect

117
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,708
stick around we've got a mind bending episode

118
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:56,625
coming up in our pop culture series about exactly that

119
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,583
scientists tried to outsmart these particles

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,166
they waited until after

121
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,625
the particles went through the slits

122
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,625
to measure them

123
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,500
guess what happened

124
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,041
the particles somehow changed their past behaviour

125
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,000
it's like

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,041
they knew they were going to be measured in the future

127
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,500
and retroactively decided how to behave

128
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,583
this is called the delayed choice experiment

129
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:21,625
and it challenges

130
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,541
our understanding of cause and effect

131
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,916
imagine deciding to record a basketball game

132
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,458
after it's already finished

133
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,541
and the players somehow change their moves

134
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,500
based on your choice to watch later

135
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,500
that's the delayed choice experiment in action

136
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,416
but we're not done yet see

137
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,750
light does this too sometimes it acts like a wave

138
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,750
making these interference patterns

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,583
other times

140
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,125
it behaves like tiny particles called photons

141
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,000
it's literally both at the same time

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,083
until we look at it

143
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,875
this made Einstein pull his remaining hair out

144
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,416
he called it spooky action at a distance

145
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,000
now flashback thousands of years

146
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,583
Buddhist masters were teaching that reality isn't fixed

147
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:06,250
until it's observed a concept called Pratityasamutpada

148
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,291
or dependent origination

149
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,291
in the Yogacara school of Buddhism

150
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,833
they specifically taught that consciousness

151
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,333
and perceived reality are inseparable

152
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,916
that nothing exists independently of the observing mind

153
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,000
they said

154
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,875
the observer and the observed can't be separated

155
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,333
everyone thought they were speaking in metaphors

156
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,583
turns out they were describing quantum physics

157
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
before we even had a word for it

158
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,875
ready to go even deeper

159
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,250
because what you just learned is only the beginning

160
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,208
and what comes next

161
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,250
will make this look like child's play

162
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,166
so if particles change when we look at them

163
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,375
what does that mean for everything around us

164
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,833
take a second and look at your surroundings

165
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,208
that chair your phone

166
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:58,041
maybe a coffee mug they're all made of particles

167
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,000
and get this

168
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,458
according to quantum physics

169
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,500
none of it exists

170
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,375
in a definite state until someone observes it

171
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,375
sounds crazy right

172
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:13,083
scientists call this the observer effect

173
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,291
let's break it down with the most famous

174
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:19,375
and controversial thought experiment ever

175
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,208
SchrÃ¶dinger's cat picture this

176
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,166
a cat is sealed in a box with a device

177
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,083
that has a 50% chance of releasing deadly poison

178
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,625
according to quantum physics

179
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,375
until someone opens that box and looks inside

180
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,333
the cat exists in both states simultaneously

181
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,500
alive and dead

182
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,916
I know pretty dark for a physics lesson

183
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,791
but stay with me

184
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,250
SchrÃ¶dinger created this thought experiment

185
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,666
to show how ridiculous quantum mechanic seemed

186
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,291
how could something be in two opposite states at once

187
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,458
but here's the plot twist

188
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,000
he accidentally proved

189
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,666
quantum physics was even weirder than anyone thought

190
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,333
Einstein hated this so much

191
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,583
he spent years arguing about it with his friend

192
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,500
Niels Bohr he famously said

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,250
"do you really believe the moon isn't there

194
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,625
if you're not looking at it"

195
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:15,166
he also wrote "I like to think the moon is there

196
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,833
even if I am not looking at it"

197
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,500
Poor Einstein the universe turned out to be

198
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
way stranger than even he could imagine

199
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,666
but this isn't just theory anymore

200
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:29,500
in groundbreaking 2021 experiments at TU Delft

201
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,458
scientists created a quantum drum

202
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,166
the width of a human hair

203
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,250
that existed in two states simultaneously

204
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,625
both vibrating and still

205
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,375
this wasn't just theoretical anymore

206
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,666
they actually achieved quantum superposition

207
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,375
with an object large enough to see with a microscope

208
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,375
they've also shown that

209
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,291
atoms won't decay until someone observes them

210
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,708
it's like reality itself is camera shy

211
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,500
this discovery revolutionizes our understanding

212
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,958
in the Lankavatara Sutra

213
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,666
one of Buddhism's most profound texts

214
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,791
Buddha explains that the world we see

215
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,625
is created by our consciousness

216
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,166
he teaches that objects don't have a fixed

217
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,833
independent existence

218
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,208
they only become real when our mind observes them

219
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,458
he even used the metaphor of waves

220
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,583
emerging from an ocean of possibilities

221
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,208
exactly like what quantum physicists call

222
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,000
the wave function collapse

223
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,875
and it goes even deeper

224
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,291
The Avatamsaka Sutra describes a reality

225
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,166
where every particle contains all other particles

226
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,458
exactly like quantum entanglement

227
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,291
the Heart Sutra's famous phrase

228
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,041
perfectly describes quantum field theory's discovery

229
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,916
that particles are just excitations

230
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:51,500
in underlying fields these aren't vague similarities

231
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,000
the texts describe specific phenomena

232
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,708
that quantum physics wouldn't confirm for millennia

233
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,416
now some physicists and scholars argue

234
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,833
these parallels might be oversimplified

235
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,791
they point out that quantum mechanics is about specific

236
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,125
mathematical models and experimental observations

237
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,541
while Buddhist teachings focus on human experience

238
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,333
and the nature of consciousness

239
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,875
while the similarities are striking

240
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,458
it's important to understand

241
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,958
they developed in very different contexts

242
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,416
with different goals

243
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,625
let's try something together

244
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,000
close your eyes for a moment

245
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,083
now open them

246
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,416
according to quantum physics

247
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,125
everything you see just collapsed into reality

248
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,500
from an infinite sea of possibilities

249
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,791
just like Buddha described

250
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,291
consciousness isn't just observing reality

251
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,500
it's participating in creating it

252
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,875
but if our minds have this much power of a reality

253
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,750
what else are they capable of

254
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,833
well that's exactly what we're about to find out

255
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,791
remember our electron going through two slits at once

256
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,541
that was just the beginning

257
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,333
scientists decided to try something even crazier

258
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,166
they fired one single electron at the slits

259
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,708
just one and somehow

260
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:16,791
that single electron

261
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,916
created an interference pattern with itself

262
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,166
it's like one person high fiving themselves

263
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,875
from multiple directions at once

264
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,166
this broke physics so badly

265
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,875
that scientists had to come up with a whole

266
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:30,208
new interpretation the Copenhagen interpretation

267
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,166
basically they said

268
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,458
reality exists as a cloud of possibilities

269
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,000
until consciousness collapses it into one outcome

270
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,666
but many scientists hated this idea

271
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,208
why?

272
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,791
because it suggests consciousness

273
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,166
itself might be the foundation of reality

274
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,041
let me say that again

275
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:53,666
your consciousness might be creating reality

276
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,333
not in some woo woo way

277
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,291
but according to hardcore physics mathematics

278
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,750
this is called the quantum measurement problem

279
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,541
and it's driving physicists nuts

280
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,541
see no one can explain how observation collapses

281
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,750
quantum possibilities into reality

282
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,875
they know it happens they can measure it

283
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,041
but they can't explain why

284
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,375
now ancient Buddhist masters like Nagarjuna

285
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,291
weren't just theorizing about this

286
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,125
they were demonstrating it

287
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,708
in the sacred texts there are accounts of masters

288
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,250
who could alter physical reality

289
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,125
through the power of their consciousness

290
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,833
people thought these were just spiritual stories

291
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,708
until quantum physics showed that consciousness

292
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,916
really does affect physical reality

293
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,083
modern day Buddhist masters

294
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:43,458
like the

295
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,583
Dalai Lama aren't surprised by quantum physics at all

296
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,958
during a mind science conference in 2015

297
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,416
when physicists explained quantum non locality to him

298
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,958
he smiled and said

299
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,541
"in Buddhist philosophy

300
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,041
particularly in the Madhyamaka view

301
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,166
we find detailed explanations of how things arise

302
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,458
through interdependence

303
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,250
and the way things exist only through designation

304
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,125
rather than from their own side"

305
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,875
the scientists were stunned

306
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,583
here was centuries old wisdom

307
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,708
describing their cutting edge discoveries

308
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,500
think this is all theoretical

309
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,625
the quantum observer effect

310
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,750
is already revolutionizing technology

311
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:29,208
quantum computers use this principle to solve problems

312
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,458
regular computers can't handle

313
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,375
scientists are developing quantum encryption

314
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:35,833
that's impossible to hack

315
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,625
because the very act of observing the data changes it

316
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,083
even medical imaging is being transformed by quantum

317
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:42,583
sensors

318
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,500
that can detect diseases earlier than ever before

319
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,333
want to experience this quantum weirdness yourself

320
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,666
try this focus intensely on any object near you

321
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,333
really look at its details

322
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:58,875
now realize

323
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,833
those particles you're looking at

324
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,000
are actually undefined

325
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,916
until your consciousness interacts with them

326
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,291
you're not just observing reality

327
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:11,083
you're participating in creating it moment by moment

328
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,166
but if consciousness can collapse

329
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,208
quantum possibilities into reality

330
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,000
there's an even more fundamental question

331
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,125
we need to ask

332
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,875
what exactly is this reality that we're collapsing

333
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,250
the answer reveals a truth so profound

334
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,291
that it challenges everything we think we know about

335
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,375
the physical world

336
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,625
here's a fact that will mess with your head

337
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,416
if you took all the actual solid matter in your body

338
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,500
and squished it together removing all the empty space

339
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,625
you'd be smaller than a grain of rice

340
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:50,333
that's right 99.99% of you is literally nothing

341
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,375
but how can this be true

342
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:57,291
pick up something solid feels real right

343
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,625
well here comes the quantum plot twist

344
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,125
what we think of as solid matter

345
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:07,125
is actually just forces pushing against each other

346
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,458
like when you try to push two magnets together

347
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,375
you feel something solid

348
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,166
but there's literally nothing between them

349
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,958
so what's really there

350
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,291
scientists call them quantum fields

351
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,208
think of it like a video game

352
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,041
the entire game world is just ones and zeros

353
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:27,958
until the computer

354
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,791
processes them into what looks like solid objects

355
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,833
our reality works the same way

356
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,750
these quantum fields are like the game's code

357
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,416
constantly creating and destroying particles

358
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,125
making what we think is solid matter

359
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,833
these quantum fields are everywhere

360
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,958
creating what we think is solid matter

361
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,250
that coffee cup you're holding

362
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,291
it's actually the electromagnetic field

363
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,708
pushing against the electron fields in your hand

364
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,083
your car isn't a solid object

365
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,833
it's countless quantum fields

366
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,875
dancing together to create the illusion of solidity

367
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,083
even light isn't just waves or particles

368
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,916
it's ripples in the electromagnetic field

369
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,250
like waves on an invisible ocean

370
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,625
and this is where Buddhism drops the mic

371
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:18,291
2500 years ago Buddha taught about sunyata emptiness

372
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,833
this doesn't mean nothing exists

373
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,416
but rather

374
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,041
that everything we perceive as solid and independent

375
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,208
is actually made up of interconnected

376
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,833
ever changing parts just as quantum physics reveals

377
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,583
particles as waves of probability

378
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,083
rather than fixed entities

379
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,625
Sunyata teaches that reality is fluid

380
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,666
dependent on our perception and interactions

381
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,208
monks were laughed at for centuries for saying this

382
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:43,041
now

383
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,083
quantum physics is proving they were right all along

384
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,291
think about your favorite game character

385
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,916
they seem solid on screen

386
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,708
they can jump fight

387
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,333
collect items but zoom in close enough

388
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,833
and what do you find just pixels

389
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,875
zoom in further just electrical signals

390
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,458
that's exactly how our reality works

391
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,666
what feels solid is actually mostly empty space

392
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,375
filled with probability waves

393
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,875
let's get personal for a second

394
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,125
your body your bones

395
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,333
everything you think is solid

396
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,083
is actually more like a hologram

397
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,541
made of quantum fields

398
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,333
you're not sitting on a chair right now

399
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,375
you're floating on a force field

400
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,250
of quantum possibilities

401
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,750
and those atoms making up your body

402
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,916
they're not even in one place at a time

403
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,250
and just when you thought it couldn't get weirder

404
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:34,625
remember how we said

405
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,625
quantum particles only become definite when observed

406
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,083
well

407
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,375
this means your entire body only takes definite form

408
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,375
because consciousness is observing it

409
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,333
without observation

410
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,625
you'd be a cloud of quantum possibilities

411
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,500
but if everything is empty

412
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,250
if nothing is truly solid

413
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,083
then what's really real

414
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,375
the answer to that is about to turn

415
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,958
everything you know about reality

416
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,541
completely upside down

417
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,541
if reality is empty and nothing is solid

418
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,375
how does anything work at all

419
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,375
well Buddha didn't just tell us

420
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,375
everything was empty he gave us the source code

421
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,958
five fundamental laws

422
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,958
that control everything in the universe

423
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,458
the five Niyamas

424
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,458
first is Utu Niyama the physical laws

425
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,375
when you drop your phone gravity pulls it down

426
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,916
but at the quantum level

427
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,916
those same laws let particles tunnel through barriers

428
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,625
and appear in multiple places simultaneously

429
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,583
it's why your GPS needs quantum corrections

430
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,708
to stay accurate

431
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,833
then there's Bija Niyama

432
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,291
Bija Niyama governs biological systems

433
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,458
remember how we said observation changes reality

434
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,541
it's why plants know which way is up without eyes

435
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,916
using quantum processes in their cells

436
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,375
it's how monarch butterflies navigate

437
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,125
using quantum

438
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:59,000
entangled molecules as internal compasses

439
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,958
living things are quantum observers

440
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,125
constantly collapsing wave functions

441
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,375
creating reality through interaction

442
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,833
just like our double slit experiment showed us

443
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,166
No. 3 is Kamma Niyama and no

444
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,416
it's not just about good and bad karma

445
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,250
it's about quantum cause and effect

446
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,041
when paired electrons remain connected across galaxies

447
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,916
they're demonstrating this law

448
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,000
your actions literally

449
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,416
create quantum ripples that affect the entire universe

450
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,500
even Einstein called this spooky

451
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:32,833
see

452
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,291
Citta Niyama explains consciousness and quantum observation

453
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,625
it's why double slit experiments change

454
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,208
based on measurement every choice you make

455
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,500
collapses infinite possibilities into one reality

456
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,166
you're doing it right now as you watch this video

457
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,500
Buddha taught that mind and matter aren't separate

458
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,916
that consciousness shapes reality

459
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,291
2,000 years later

460
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,875
quantum physics proved this with the observer effect

461
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,583
coincidence I think not

462
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,041
finally there's Dhamma Niyama

463
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,208
the fundamental nature of reality itself

464
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,333
remember that quantum field creating your coffee cup

465
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,541
that same field extends through the entire universe

466
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,750
nothing exists in isolation

467
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,333
everything is connected through these quantum fields

468
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,000
exactly as Buddha taught

469
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,583
here's the fascinating part

470
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,083
while these parallels are compelling

471
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,625
we should approach them with both excitement

472
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,375
and careful consideration

473
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,166
some scientists argue that quantum physics

474
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,958
and Buddhist wisdom though both profound

475
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,541
might be describing different levels of reality

476
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,541
the quantum world operates by precise

477
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,958
mathematical rules

478
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,750
while Buddhist insights come from deep meditation

479
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,500
and philosophical analysis

480
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,500
maybe the truth lies in understanding both perspectives

481
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,375
each valuable in its own way

482
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,791
rather than trying to make them exactly the same

483
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,500
so what does this mean for you

484
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,166
everything you see everything you touch

485
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,916
every moment of your life

486
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,958
is running on the same principles

487
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,000
you're not just living in reality

488
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,750
you're actively participating in creating it

489
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,958
your consciousness isn't just observing the universe

490
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,291
it's part of the code that makes it real

491
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,500
and if you understand this

492
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,291
if you really get what this means

493
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,000
everything changes

494
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,916
because once you know the code

495
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,541
once you see how reality really works

496
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,833
you can never look at your world the same way again

497
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,750
these aren't just cool facts

498
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,416
understanding quantum reality

499
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:39,083
can transform how you approach everyday challenges

500
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,000
when you're stuck on a problem

501
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,833
remember quantum superposition

502
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,958
multiple solutions can exist simultaneously

503
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,625
until you observe them

504
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,583
feeling disconnected

505
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,750
quantum entanglement shows us

506
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,416
were fundamentally connected to everything around us

507
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,958
worried about making the wrong choice

508
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,583
every decision you make

509
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,750
is literally creating one reality

510
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,541
from infinite possibilities

511
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,625
just like quantum observation collapses

512
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,166
probability waves into definite states

513
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,250
ready for the final revelation

514
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,708
because what comes next will show you how to

515
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:18,750
use this knowledge to transform your entire reality

516
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,500
so here's where everything comes together

517
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,708
remember that wall I tried to walk through at the start

518
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,166
well now you know it's not really solid

519
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,500
nothing is

520
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:37,291
reality isn't fixed it's a dance between consciousness

521
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,125
and quantum possibilities

522
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:42,041
you're not just a passive observer in this universe

523
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,750
you're an active participant in creating reality

524
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,458
every time you focus your attention

525
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,791
every time you make an observation

526
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,125
you're collapsing quantum possibilities into

527
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,500
actual reality

528
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,708
just like those ancient Buddhist masters understood

529
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,791
think about what this really means

530
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,541
your consciousness isn't just along for the ride

531
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:05,458
it's fundamental to how reality works

532
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:09,125
those quantum particles that empty space

533
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:11,125
those probability waves

534
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,458
they're all waiting for you to interact with them

535
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,666
to make them real

536
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,458
want to experience this power

537
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,458
close your eyes for a moment

538
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,083
now open them

539
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:24,750
everything you see

540
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,875
just emerged from an infinite sea of possibilities

541
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,750
because your consciousness interacted with it

542
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,916
you just participated in creating reality

543
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,208
and you do this every single moment of every day

544
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,666
the ancient Buddhist weren't just being metaphorical

545
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,958
when they said the mind creates the world

546
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,500
they were describing the deepest truth about reality

547
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,375
that science has ever discovered

548
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,500
and now you know it too

549
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,208
so what are you going to do with this knowledge

550
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,833
how will you use your reality shaping consciousness

551
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,583
will you stay trapped in old patterns of thinking

552
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,166
or will you embrace your role

553
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:02,333
as an active creator of reality

554
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,041
if you want to explore more

555
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,375
amazing connections between modern science

556
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,000
and ancient Buddhist wisdom

557
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,875
hit that subscribe button and the notification bell

558
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:17,583
because trust me what we cover today

559
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:20,416
is just the beginning of how weird reality gets

560
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,041
until then remember

561
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,625
you're not just watching reality unfold

562
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,125
you're helping create it

563
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,291
and that that changes everything

564
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:33,916
see you in the Quantum Realm
