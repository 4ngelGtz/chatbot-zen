your heart races palm sweat

00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:15,633
three hours have passed

5
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,900
and your crush still hasn't responded to your hey

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,666
message whoa

7
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:20,833
pause for a second

8
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:24,266
how did a simple text bubble gain so much power over us?

9
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,500
I'm Matt and I've fallen into the attachment trap too

10
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:30,800
ever obsessively checked your messages

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,500
or felt your mood nose dive

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,433
when your partner doesn't reply instantly?

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,200
welcome to the club

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,900
here's a wild thought

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,266
what if you could love deeply without losing yourself?

16
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:48,633
an ancient secret over 2,500 years old

17
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:50,833
holds the key to relationship peace

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,866
spoiler

19
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,800
it's not about finding the perfect partner

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,100
it's about revolutionizing your approach to love itself

21
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:02,200
welcome to Buddha's wisdom

22
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:05,633
today we're exploring the art of non attachment in love

23
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,833
think of it as putting your heart in airplane mode

24
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,366
you stay connected

25
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:13,233
but you're not constantly pinging for validation

26
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:16,400
ready to unlock the super power of loving

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,000
without clinging stay tuned

28
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,866
in the next 15 minutes

29
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:23,066
you might discover the secret to relationship bliss

30
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:25,166
you've been swiping right for all along

31
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:32,566
attachment in love often disguises itself as devotion

32
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,100
it manifests as an overwhelming fear of loss

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,400
a constant craving for reassurance

34
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:41,200
or an impulse to control your partner's life

35
00:01:41,766 --> 00:01:43,533
many believe their happiness depends

36
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:45,566
entirely on another person's actions

37
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:46,600
or presence

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,300
this intense attachment breeds suffering

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,000
clinging too tightly suffocates love

40
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,700
it fosters neediness jealousy and possessiveness

41
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,200
our self worth becomes intertwined with our partner's

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,000
approval

43
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,766
when expectations go unmet

44
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,833
emotional turmoil ensues

45
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:09,400
the Buddha taught

46
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,966
this is especially true in relationships

47
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:16,066
where our attachments can lead to jealousy

48
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,000
possessiveness and fear

49
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,533
in our previous video on Karma

50
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:23,266
we explored how actions shape experiences

51
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,033
attachment in love operates similarly

52
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,800
the more we grasp the more disappointment we invite

53
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:30,900
it resembles

54
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,433
attempting to hold water with a clenched fist

55
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:37,266
increased pressure only causes it to escape faster

56
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,000
conversely healthy love flourishes with freedom

57
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:44,700
it unites two complete individuals

58
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,400
who choose to share their lives

59
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,466
rather than two incomplete halves

60
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:50,266
desperately clinging to each other

61
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:52,733
it involves appreciating your partner

62
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:54,300
without a need for possession

63
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,833
and nurturing growth instead of restricting it

64
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,066
breaking free from this attachment trap

65
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:02,800
requires embracing the wisdom of non attachment

66
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,966
this approach doesn't advocate becoming

67
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:07,400
emotionally distant instead

68
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:10,966
it teaches us to love more deeply by loosening our grip

69
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,700
curious to learn more?

70
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,700
let's explore this transformative concept

71
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,166
let's look at a real life example

72
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,766
imagine Sarah

73
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:24,600
who checks her boyfriend's online status every hour

74
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,400
feeling anxious when he doesn't respond immediately

75
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,400
or Michael who cancels plans with friends

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
because his girlfriend might call

77
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
these are classic signs of attachment

78
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,033
masquerading as love

79
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,400
interestingly a study

80
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,966
published in

81
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:41,566
the journal of social and Personal Relationships

82
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,533
found that individuals with anxious attachment styles

83
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:47,100
reported lower relationship satisfaction

84
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,066
and higher levels of conflict

85
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:52,433
science backs up what Buddha taught centuries ago

86
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,433
Buddha taught about a concept called up훮d훮na

87
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,400
often translated as clinging or attachment

88
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:04,366
in love up훮d훮na

89
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:06,366
manifests as an obsessive need to control

90
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:08,166
our relationships or partners

91
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,200
it's like trying to catch a butterfly

92
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,966
by closing your fist around it

93
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:15,166
you'll either crush it or cause it to fly away

94
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,500
consider these words from the Dhammapada

95
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,966
this reminds us how attachment can consume us

96
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:32,066
if we're not mindful

97
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,366
Buddhism encourages us to love with open hands

98
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,733
this approach allows us to cherish our partners

99
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,200
without suffocating them

100
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:41,600
it's about appreciating the present moment

101
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,966
in our relationships

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,200
without anxiously grasping at a future we can't control

103
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,400
consider this ancient Buddhist tale

104
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,766
a monk encounters a woman at a river's edge

105
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:53,033
unable to cross

106
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:56,033
despite strict rules against touching women

107
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:57,466
he carries her across

108
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:00,600
hours later his companion

109
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,266
still troubled by this act

110
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:03,300
confronts him

111
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:07,400
the monk replies I left the woman at the river

112
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:09,633
why are you still carrying her

113
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,100
this story illuminates the essence of non attachment

114
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,900
in love

115
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,533
it teaches us to engage fully in our relationships

116
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,833
without letting them burden our peace of mind

117
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,266
we learn to love deeply in the moment

118
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:22,300
then let go

119
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,733
avoiding the weight of excessive expectations

120
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,066
or past grievances

121
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:30,766
non attachment differs starkly from indifference

122
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,800
it doesn't mean loving less

123
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,666
it means loving more wisely

124
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:37,133
it's about cultivating a love so secure

125
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:39,400
that it doesn't need constant reassurance

126
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:41,666
a love that celebrates your partner's freedom

127
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,266
as much as their presence

128
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,900
in our video 8 steps to Nirvana

129
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,900
to Reach Peace

130
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,400
we explored the path to inner tranquility

131
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,000
non attachment in love

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
forms a crucial part of this journey

133
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:55,300
by releasing our grip on controlling

134
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,066
outcomes in our relationships

135
00:05:57,066 --> 00:06:01,033
we open ourselves to a profound liberating form of love

136
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:05,900
views on attachment in love vary across cultures

137
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,066
while many eastern philosophies

138
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,333
including Buddhism

139
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,200
have long emphasized the importance of non attachment

140
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,533
western cultures often portray intense

141
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:16,966
emotional attachment as the ideal of romantic love

142
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:19,066
however it's important to note

143
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:21,200
that these are broad generalizations

144
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:22,866
and individuals within each culture

145
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:24,500
may hold diverse perspectives

146
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:27,400
the key is to understand how different

147
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,300
cultural contexts shape our views on love

148
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,466
and attachment and to find an approach that promotes

149
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:36,833
genuine happiness and well being in our relationships

150
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,966
regardless of cultural background

151
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,133
the Buddha said

152
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:52,666
by practicing non attachment in love

153
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,766
we align ourselves with this principle

154
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:55,966
finding a deeper

155
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:59,166
more sustainable form of happiness in our relationships

156
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,566
embracing non attachment in love

157
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:03,966
transforms relationships profoundly

158
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,366
it fosters healthier more balanced connections

159
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,200
allowing both partners to thrive

160
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,400
independently and together

161
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,766
by releasing the need to control

162
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,400
you cultivate trust

163
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:18,233
this trust acts as a sturdy foundation

164
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:20,533
enabling your relationship to weather storms

165
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:21,666
with resilience

166
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,833
you'll find yourself less reactive to minor issues

167
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,600
creating a more peaceful dynamic

168
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,733
non attachment nurtures personal growth

169
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:31,833
within relationships

170
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:35,200
it encourages you to maintain your individuality

171
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:37,466
pursuing your passions and goals

172
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:40,833
this self development enriches your partnership

173
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
bringing fresh energy and experiences to share

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,466
anxiety and relationships often stems from attachment

175
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:51,933
practicing non attachment reduces this anxiety

176
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:53,000
significantly

177
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:55,666
you worry less about potential outcomes

178
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,666
and focus more on

179
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,800
enjoying the present moment with your partner

180
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:00,366
a 2019 study by researchers Kimis Jarequi

181
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:03,166
a 2019 study by researchers Kimmes Jaurequi

182
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,766
Roberts Harris and Fincham

183
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,033
published in the journal of Happiness Studies

184
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,600
found that individuals practicing mindfulness

185
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,566
and non attachment reported

186
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:15,366
significantly lower levels of relationship anxiety

187
00:08:15,366 --> 00:08:17,700
and higher overall life satisfaction

188
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:20,366
their research suggests that these practices

189
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,900
can contribute to more fulfilling

190
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,500
romantic relationships

191
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,733
think of non attachment as wearing a life jacket

192
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:29,666
in the sea of love you're still fully immersed

193
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:32,366
but you're not desperately clinging to stay afloat

194
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:33,500
this security

195
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,000
allows you to enjoy the experience more fully

196
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,400
interestingly non attachment deepens intimacy

197
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,666
by letting go of expectations

198
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,033
you create space for genuine connection

199
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,233
you see your partner clearly

200
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:50,166
appreciating them for who they are

201
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,033
rather than who you want them to be

202
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,100
non attachment also enhances communication

203
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,300
without the fear of loss driving your interactions

204
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:03,233
you express your needs and feelings more honestly

205
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:06,866
this openness paves the way for authentic

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,600
meaningful dialogues

207
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,900
remember our video on forgiveness

208
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,000
non attachment compliments this practice beautifully

209
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,366
it allows you to let go of past hurts more easily

210
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,300
preventing resentment from poisoning your relationship

211
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:23,600
by embracing non attachment

212
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,466
you unlock a new level of freedom in your relationship

213
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,400
you love without conditions support

214
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,100
without smothering and connect without losing yourself

215
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:35,733
it's a pathway to a more fulfilling

216
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:37,466
harmonious partnership

217
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:44,366
let's see some practical ways to cultivate non

218
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:45,666
attachment in love

219
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:49,033
these techniques will help you love more deeply

220
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:51,100
while maintaining your independence

221
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:53,966
start with mindfulness

222
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:55,966
pay attention to your thoughts

223
00:09:55,966 --> 00:09:57,366
and feelings about your relationship

224
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:58,466
without judgment

225
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,800
notice when you're clinging to outcomes or expectations

226
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:04,500
this awareness alone can loosen attachments

227
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,200
grip remember the Buddhist words

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,600
this is the essence of mindfulness in relationships

229
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,200
practice self love and self sufficiency

230
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:25,366
nurture your interests friendships

231
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:27,666
and personal growth outside the relationship

232
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:30,766
remember you're a complete individual

233
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:31,900
not half of a whole

234
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,766
communicate openly with your partner

235
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,800
express your needs clearly

236
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:39,666
but release attachment to specific responses

237
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:42,600
use I statements to convey your feelings

238
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,200
without placing demands

239
00:10:46,566 --> 00:10:48,700
embrace impermanence in your relationship

240
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:50,366
recognize that feelings

241
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:53,266
situations and even relationships change

242
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,766
instead of resisting this truth

243
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,366
allow it to

244
00:10:56,366 --> 00:10:58,833
deepen your appreciation for the present moment

245
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,066
find joy in your partner's freedom and growth

246
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:04,100
celebrate their successes

247
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,066
even when they don't involve you

248
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,333
support their individual journey

249
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,033
as much as your shared path

250
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:14,566
when jealousy or possessiveness arise pause

251
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,633
take a deep breath

252
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,566
and remind yourself that love isn't ownership

253
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:22,833
choose to trust instead of control

254
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,100
practice gratitude for what your relationship offers

255
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,900
now rather than focusing on what you wish it could be

256
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:32,433
this shift in perspective fosters contentment

257
00:11:32,466 --> 00:11:34,666
and reduces attachment to ideals

258
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,166
lastly remember the art of letting go

259
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,800
when conflicts arise address them

260
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:45,166
then release them

261
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:49,200
don't let past issues color your present interactions

262
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:51,600
by implementing these practices

263
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,700
you'll cultivate a love that's both deep and freeing

264
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,966
it's a journey so be patient with yourself

265
00:11:58,366 --> 00:12:00,100
with time you'll discover

266
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,366
the profound peace that comes from loving

267
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:03,666
without attachment

268
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,966
here's a real world example

269
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,366
John used to feel insecure

270
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:10,233
when his partner wanted alone time

271
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,166
by practicing non attachment

272
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,066
he learned to see this time apart

273
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,233
as an opportunity for both of them to grow individually

274
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:19,633
ultimately strengthening their relationship

275
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,266
let's clear the air about some common misconceptions

276
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:27,333
surrounding non attachment

277
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,133
in love

278
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:30,800
many people hear non attachment

279
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,466
and picture emotional distance

280
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:33,833
or a lack of care

281
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:36,700
nothing could be further from the truth

282
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,466
the Buddha taught

283
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,733
this reminds us that non attachment starts with self

284
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:56,200
love non attachment doesn't mean becoming cold or aloof

285
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,266
in your relationships it's not about building walls

286
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:01,066
or avoiding deep connections

287
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:03,500
instead it's about loving fully

288
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,100
while letting go of the need to control outcomes

289
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:09,200
some worry that practicing non attachment

290
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,800
will diminish their love in reality

291
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,266
it often deepens it

292
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,933
by releasing expectations

293
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,833
and accepting your partner as they are

294
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,966
you create space for a more authentic connection

295
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,200
another misconception

296
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,833
is that non attachment equals commitment phobia

297
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:29,500
on the contrary it allows for healthier commitments

298
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:32,366
you choose to be with your partner each day

299
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:35,700
not out of need or fear but out of genuine desire

300
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,100
people often confuse non attachment with indifference

301
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,566
however non attachment involves caring deeply

302
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:46,700
while maintaining emotional balance

303
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:48,266
it's about loving

304
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:51,433
without letting that love consume your entire identity

305
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,466
some believe practicing non attachment means

306
00:13:56,466 --> 00:13:59,466
never experiencing negative emotions in relationships

307
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:02,866
this isn't true you'll still feel hurt

308
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:04,766
anger or jealousy

309
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:06,266
the difference lies in

310
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:08,100
how you respond to these feelings

311
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,433
lastly non attachment doesn't mean

312
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:14,633
giving up on improving your relationship

313
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:17,800
you can still work on issues and grow together

314
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:19,566
the key is doing so

315
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:20,966
without attaching your happiness

316
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:22,966
solely to the relationship status

317
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,666
understanding these misconceptions

318
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,666
helps clear the path to practicing healthy

319
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,000
non attachment it's not about loving less

320
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,500
it's about loving more wisely

321
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,000
more freely and more authentically

322
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,900
we've journeyed through the art of non attachment

323
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,700
in love uncovering its power to transform relationships

324
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,766
by loving without clinging

325
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,700
we open ourselves to deeper

326
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,600
more authentic connections

327
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,000
remember non attachment isn't about detachment

328
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,800
it's about embracing love fully

329
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,866
while releasing the need to control

330
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:02,033
it's choosing to love your partner for who they are

331
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:03,900
not who you want them to be

332
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:07,066
this path isn't always easy

333
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,833
it challenges our ingrained habits and fears

334
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,266
but the rewards greater peace

335
00:15:12,266 --> 00:15:13,466
deeper intimacy

336
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,366
and a love unburden by expectations make it worthwhile

337
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,200
as you move forward start small

338
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:22,900
practice mindfulness in your interactions

339
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:26,200
notice when you're clinging and gently let go

340
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,700
celebrate your partner's individuality

341
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,433
nurture your own growth alongside the relationship

342
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,533
we'd love to hear about your experiences

343
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:39,300

complement today's topic beautifully

351

remember every moment

352
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,166
offers a new opportunity to practice non attachment

353
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,533
with each breath you can choose to love more freely

354
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,866
more deeply and more wisely

355
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,466
in the end only three things matter

356
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:13,100
how much you loved how gently you lived

357
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,766
and how gracefully you let go of things

358
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:15,833
not meant for you

359
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,700
thank you for joining me on Buddha's wisdom

360
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,966
until next time may your love flow as freely as a river

361
00:16:21,966 --> 00:16:23,566
nourishing without drowning

362
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,566
moving without forcing and always always growing
