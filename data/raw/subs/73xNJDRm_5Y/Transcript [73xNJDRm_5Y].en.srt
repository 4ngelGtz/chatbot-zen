53
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,640
story about my former self you see I

54
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,080
used to be known as The Grudge Guru I

55
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,319
was the master of holding on to

56
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,440
resentment nurturing it like a precious

57
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,920
bonsai tree if someone wrong me I would

58
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,840
add them to my mental Grudge list vowing

59
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,040
never to forget or forgive their

60
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,000
transgression I thought I was protecting

61
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,200
myself building a fortress of

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,680
righteousness around my heart but in

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,640
reality I was only imprisoning myself in

64
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,200
a cage of my own making my grudges

65
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,239
became my constant companions Whispering

66
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,040
bitter thoughts in my ear and tainting

67
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,879
every interaction with suspicion and

68
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,480
anger it wasn't until a particularly

69
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,400
painful betrayal that I hit my Breaking

70
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,920
Point a close friend someone I trusted

71
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,959
deeply had spoken ill of me behind my

72
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,280
back when I found out I was consumed

73
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,440
with rage and hurt I spent days plotting

74
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,640
my revenge fantasizing in about the

75
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,400
perfect comeuppence but then something

76
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,680
unexpected happened in the midst of my

77
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,400
rumination I caught a glimpse of myself

78
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,280
in the mirror I hardly recognized the

79
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,480
person staring back at me my face was

80
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,640
contorted with anger my eyes Hollow and

81
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,120
lifeless I realized that my grudge had

82
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,200
turned me into someone I no longer

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,640
wanted to

84
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,920
be that moment was a turning point for

85
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,439
me I knew I needed to find a way to

86
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,599
break free from the prison of my own

87
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:36,319
resentment and that's when I stumbled

88
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,599
upon the teachings of the Buddha in the

89
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,159
Buddha's wisdom I found a radical new

90
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,319
approach to dealing with hurt and

91
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,920
betrayal the Buddha taught that holding

92
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,280
on to anger is like grasping a hot coal

93
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,760
with the intent of throwing it at

94
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,439
someone else you are the one who gets

95
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,599
burned forgiveness on the other hand is

96
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,680
like releasing that coal allowing

97
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:00,159
yourself to heal and move

98
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,120
forward it was a revelation for me I

99
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,319
realized that forgiveness wasn't about

100
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,439
condoning the other person's actions or

101
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,120
forgetting the pain they caused it was

102
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,360
about choosing to let go of the burning

103
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,920
coal of resentment so I could free

104
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,640
myself from suffering of course this

105
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,479
realization didn't magically erase all

106
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,759
my grudges overnight forgiveness is a

107
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,360
skill that requires practice and

108
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,880
patience but with each small Act of

109
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,600
forgiveness I felt a little lighter a

110
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,160
little more at peace and that my friends

111
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,240
is how the grudge Guru began began his

112
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,120
transformation into the Forgiveness

113
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,759
fanatic it's been a wild and bumpy ride

114
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,800
full of challenges and setbacks but

115
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,120
along the way I've discovered the

116
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,720
life-changing power of forgiveness so if

117
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,960
you're ready to join me on this journey

118
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,960
from resentment to Freedom buckle

119
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,840
up in the next few minutes we'll explore

120
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,240
the science of why forgiveness is so

121
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,000
hard and I'll share some practical tools

122
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,520
to help you start your own forgiveness

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,520
practice let's do this

124
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,680
before jumping into the Practical

125
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,759
strategies for forgiveness let's take a

126
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,000
moment to understand why letting go of

127
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,520
resentment can be so

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,320
challenging turns out there's some

129
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,280
fascinating science behind our Grudge

130
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,400
holding Tendencies you see when someone

131
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,120
wrongs us our brain's threat detection

132
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,520
system goes into high alert our amydala

133
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,360
the part of the brain responsible for

134
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,280
processing emotions sounds the alarm

135
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,800
triggering a Cascade of physiological

136
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,680
responses

137
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,639
our heart rate increases our muscles

138
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,759
tense up and our body is flooded with

139
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,400
stress hormones like cortisol and

140
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,560
adrenaline in the short term this stress

141
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,400
response can be adaptive helping us to

142
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,319
defend ourselves against potential

143
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,960
threats but when we hold on to

144
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,240
resentment long after the initial

145
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,319
offense our brain can get stuck in a

146
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,080
loop of rumination and

147
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,800
negativity Studies have shown that

148
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,880
ruminating on past grievances activates

149
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,120
the same neural Pathways as physical

150
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,520
pain in other words every time we Replay

151
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,319
that hurtful scenario in our mind we're

152
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,440
essentially reliving the pain over and

153
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:10,199
over again it's like picking at a scab

154
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,560
we may feel a temporary sense of

155
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,919
satisfaction but in the long run we're

156
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,720
only prolonging the healing

157
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:19,280
process moreover chronic resentment can

158
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,680
have serious consequences for our

159
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,199
physical and mental health holding on to

160
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,280
anger and stress has been linked to a

161
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,680
weakened immune system high blood

162
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,960
pressure and an increased risk of heart

163
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,160
disease it can also contribute to

164
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,639
anxiety depression and difficulty in

165
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,199
forming healthy

166
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,440
relationships but here's the good news

167
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,919
just as our brains can get stuck in a

168
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,880
negative feedback loop we also have the

169
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:46,800
power to rewire them for forgiveness and

170
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,440
resilience by practicing forgiveness we

171
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,160
can activate the parts of our brain

172
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,960
associated with empathy compassion and

173
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,360
positive emotions in fact research has

174
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,280
shown that forgiveness can have a

175
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,080
profound impact on our well-being people

176
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,280
who practice forgiveness support lower

177
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,680
levels of stress anxiety and depression

178
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,080
as well as Greater Life satisfaction and

179
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,199
emotional

180
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,680
stability forgiveness has even been

181
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,240
linked to improved cardiovascular health

182
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,560
and a stronger immune system so while

183
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,919
forgiveness may not come naturally to us

184
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,360
it's a skill that we can cultivate

185
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,560
through practice and

186
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,639
intention by understanding the science

187
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,759
behind resentment and its impact on our

188
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,479
minds and bodies we can find the

189
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,520
motivation to let go of our grudges and

190
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:32,520
Embrace a more forgiving

191
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,560
mindset it's time to talk about the

192
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,879
Practical tools for cultivating

193
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,680
forgiveness I like to call this our

194
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,360
forgiveness toolkit a collection of

195
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,560
strategies and practices that can help

196
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,199
us work through even the most stubborn

197
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,000
grudges the First Tool in our kit is

198
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,960
what I call the acknowledge empathize

199
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,400
release

200
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,319
framework this three-step process is a

201
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,440
powerful way to work through resentment

202
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:04,680
and find our way to forgiveness step one

203
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,919
acknowledge this means taking an honest

204
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,639
look at our pain and the impact it's had

205
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:13,120
on our lives it's about validating our

206
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:15,639
own feelings without judgment or blame

207
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,440
we might say something like I was really

208
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:21,680
hurt when my friend betrayed my trust it

209
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,159
made me feel angry sad and scared to be

210
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,199
vulnerable

211
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:28,240
again step two

212
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,520
empathize this is where we try to see

213
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,640
the situation from the other person's

214
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,560
perspective now this doesn't mean

215
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,599
condoning their behavior or excusing

216
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,760
their actions but it does mean

217
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,360
recognizing that they too are human

218
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,399
beings with their own struggles and

219
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,000
limitations we might say I can imagine

220
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,000
that my friend was going through a tough

221
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,519
time and wasn't thinking clearly when

222
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,839
they acted that way they're not a bad

223
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,040
person even though their actions caused

224
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,040
me

225
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,959
pain step three release this is where we

226
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,560
make the choice to let go of our

227
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,360
resentment and move forward it's about

228
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,160
recognizing that holding on to anger is

229
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,200
only hurting ourselves and that

230
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,200
forgiveness is a gift we give to

231
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,600
ourselves we might say I'm choosing to

232
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,320
release my anger towards my friend I

233
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,839
forgive them not because they deserve it

234
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,720
but because I deserve peace I'm letting

235
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,760
go of this burden so I can move forward

236
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,240
with my

237
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,880
life now I know this process is easier

238
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,720
said than done that's why our

239
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,480
forgiveness toolkit also includes some

240
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,120
practical exercises to help us work

241
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,040
through each step for the acknowledged

242
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,160
step we might try journaling about our

243
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,560
feelings or sharing our story with a

244
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,440
trusted friend the act of putting our

245
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,920
pain into words can be incredibly

246
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,000
validating and healing for the

247
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,240
empathized step we might try a loving

248
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,240
kindness meditation where we cultivate

249
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,880
compassion for ourselves and others we

250
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,120
might also try to imagine the other

251
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,560
person's perspective and consider the

252
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,440
ways in which their own pain or fear

253
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,440
might have contributed to their actions

254
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,640
and for the release step we might try a

255
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,440
ritual of Letting Go like writing a

256
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,040
letter of forgiveness and burning it or

257
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,000
visualizing ourselves releasing a

258
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,880
balloon filled with our

259
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,399
resentment remember forgiveness is a

260
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,399
process not a ontime

261
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,079
event it's okay if it takes time and

262
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,519
it's okay if we need to repeat these

263
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:28,079
steps multiple times the important thing

264
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,680
is that we're taking action to free

265
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,279
ourselves from the burden of resentment

266
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,880
get ready to flexx those forgiveness

267
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,880
muscles and watch your world

268
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,240
transform now that we've got our

269
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,760
forgiveness toolkit in hand it's time to

270
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,720
take this show on the road welcome to

271
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,360
the Forgiveness field trip where we'll

272
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,120
be putting our Newfound skills to the

273
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,839
test in the wild world of everyday

274
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,839
annoyances and interpersonal

275
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,959
conflicts our first stop on the

276
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,639
Forgiveness field trip is the land of

277
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,200
minor irritations you know those little

278
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,079
things that aren't necessarily a big

279
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,079
deal but can still get under our skin

280
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,959
and fester into full-blown resentment if

281
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,880
we're not careful for example just the

282
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,920
other day I was at the grocery store

283
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,720
minding my own business when a fellow

284
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,079
Shopper rammed their cart into the back

285
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,200
of my heels now in the past I might have

286
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,360
spun around and given them a piece of my

287
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,480
mind but armed with my forgiveness tool

288
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,200
kit I took a different

289
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,480
approach first I acknowledged my own

290
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,480
pain and frustration

291
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,839
ouch that really hurt and I feel annoyed

292
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,680
that this person wasn't being more

293
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,279
careful then I tried to empathize with

294
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,000
the other person's

295
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:43,480
perspective maybe they're having a

296
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,959
really stressful day or they're

297
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,480
distracted by something going on in

298
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,480
their life they probably didn't mean to

299
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,519
hurt

300
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,800
me finally I made the choice to release

301
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,160
my

302
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,560
resentment I'm going to choose to let

303
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,720
this go I don't need to hold on to this

304
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,560
minor annoyance and let it ruin my day

305
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,760
and you know what it worked instead of

306
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,200
stewing in my anger I was able to shrug

307
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,440
it off and move on with my shopping it

308
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,240
may seem like a small victory but these

309
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,360
little acts of forgiveness can add up to

310
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,160
a much more peaceful and positive

311
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,120
outlook on life but the Forgiveness

312
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,560
field trip isn't just about the small

313
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,639
stuff we'll also be tackling some bigger

314
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,720
challenges like forgiving a friend who

315
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,880
let us down or working through a

316
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,639
long-held family Grudge I'll be honest

317
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,800
these ones can be a lot tougher it's one

318
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:35,360
thing to let go of a fleeting annoyance

319
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,160
but it's another thing entirely to

320
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,320
forgive someone who's caused us deep

321
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,160
pain or

322
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,440
betrayal but here's the thing the

323
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,240
process is the same no matter how big or

324
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,639
small the

325
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,360
offense we start by acknowledging our

326
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,040
own pain and the impact it's had on our

327
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,279
lives we try to empathize with the other

328
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,279
person's perspective even if we don't

329
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,399
agree with their actions and finally we

330
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,199
make the choice to release our

331
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,040
resentment and move forward it's not

332
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,800
easy and it's not always quick forgiving

333
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,399
a major betrayal can be a long and

334
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,920
winding road with plenty of setbacks and

335
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,399
detours along the way but every step we

336
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,839
take towards forgiveness is a step

337
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,440
towards our own healing and

338
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:21,000
Liberation and that's what this

339
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,760
forgiveness field trip is all about

340
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,800
learning to navigate the twists and

341
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,360
turns of forgiveness in the real world

342
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,920
it's about building our forgiveness

343
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,839
muscles one minor IR irritation and

344
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,279
major conflict at a

345
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,279
time the road to Freedom Starts

346
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,680
Now I want to share with you a profound

347
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,240
moment that changed the course of my own

348
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,680
Journey it was a realization that hit me

349
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,920
like a bolt of lightning a forgiveness

350
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,800
Epiphany that shifted my entire

351
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,680
perspective on what it means to let go I

352
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,160
was in the middle of a particularly

353
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,079
challenging forgiveness practice working

354
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,320
through some deep Ed resentment towards

355
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,759
a family member who had hurt me in the

356
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,320
past I had been dutifully following the

357
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,120
steps of the Forgiveness

358
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,399
toolkit acknowledging my pain trying to

359
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,600
empathize with their perspective and

360
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:17,320
making the choice to release my

361
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,880
anger but something still felt stuck no

362
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,199
matter how many times I went through the

363
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,440
motions I couldn't seem to find that

364
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,279
sense of freedom and peace that I was

365
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,560
seeking and then in the midst of a quiet

366
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,560
meditation session it hit me

367
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,079
forgiveness isn't about the other person

368
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,079
at all it's about me it's about my own

369
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:38,720
healing my own Liberation from the

370
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,920
chains of

371
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,800
resentment you see I had been

372
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,000
approaching forgiveness as a sort of

373
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,440
transaction I thought that if I forgave

374
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,800
this person it would somehow erase the

375
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,320
pain they had caused me or make them see

376
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,279
the error of their ways but in that

377
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,600
Moment of clarity I realize that

378
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:58,639
forgiveness is not a bargaining chip

379
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,880
it's a gift that we give to ourselves

380
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,079
regard of how the other person

381
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,240
responds this realization brought to

382
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,560
mind a powerful story from the Buddha's

383
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,440
life one day the Buddha was traveling

384
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,440
through a village when an angry man

385
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,199
approached him and began to hurl insults

386
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,360
and accusations at him the Buddha

387
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,040
remained calm and composed listening

388
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,120
patiently to the man's TI raade when the

389
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,199
man had finished the Buddha simply asked

390
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,639
if someone offers you a gift and you

391
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,720
refuse to accept it to whom does the

392
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:32,440
gift belong

393
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,079
the man was puzzled but answered it

394
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:38,800
would still Belong To The Giver the

395
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:41,519
Buddha smiled and said in the same way I

396
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,880
do not accept your anger and insults

397
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,600
they remain with

398
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,360
you this story illustrates the profound

399
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,880
truth that forgiveness is not about

400
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,240
changing the other person or erasing the

401
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,759
past it's about choosing to release the

402
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,160
burden of resentment that we carry so

403
00:15:54,759 --> 00:16:00,000
that we can move forward with Grace and

404
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,079
ease when we forgive we're not saying

405
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,399
that what happened was okay or that the

406
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,480
other person is off the hook we're

407
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,600
simply recognizing that holding on to

408
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,959
anger and bitterness is a heavy load

409
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,959
that we no longer wish to Bear we're

410
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,079
choosing to set ourselves free to

411
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,720
reclaim our own peace and happiness

412
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:20,160
regardless of what the other person does

413
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,040
or doesn't do this forgiveness Epiphany

414
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,759
was a turning point for me it shifted my

415
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,079
focus from trying to change the other

416
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,399
person to taking responsibility for my

417
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:30,920
own healing it allowed owed me to

418
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,759
approach forgiveness with a sense of

419
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,680
empowerment and

420
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,639
self-compassion rather than a sense of

421
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,759
obligation or guilt and the amazing

422
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:41,519
thing is when we approach forgiveness

423
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,600
from this place of self-love and inner

424
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,880
Freedom it has a ripple effect that

425
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,120
extends far beyond our own lives when we

426
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,120
model forgiveness and compassion we

427
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,079
Inspire others to do the same we create

428
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,079
a world where healing and Reconciliation

429
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,560
are possible where cycles of anger and

430
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:02,519
retaliation can be broken by the power

431
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,919
of the human spirit so I invite you to

432
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,319
reflect on your own forgiveness Epiphany

433
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,480
what might it mean for you to approach

434
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,079
forgiveness as a gift to yourself rather

435
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,919
than a demand on others how might this

436
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:14,679
shift in perspective change the way you

437
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:17,480
navigate the challenges and conflicts of

438
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,919
your life let's keep this wisdom close

439
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,600
to our hearts forgiveness is not about

440
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,559
them it's about us it's about our own

441
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,919
Freedom our own healing our own infinite

442
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:32,480
capacity for love and compassion and

443
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,480
that my friends is a truly revolutionary

444
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,559
act forgiveness is a deeply personal

445
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,559
Journey a choice we make to free

446
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,480
ourselves from the burden of resentment

447
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:46,280
and anger but the impact of forgiveness

448
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,720
doesn't stop there when we Embrace

449
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,679
forgiveness as a way of life it creates

450
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,880
a ripple effect that touches everyone

451
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:56,120
around us and even has the power to

452
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,799
transform society as a whole think about

453
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,039
it every time we choose to respond

454
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,480
respond to a hurt or conflict with

455
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,240
compassion and understanding rather than

456
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,720
anger and retaliation we're sending a

457
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,000
powerful message out into the world

458
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,159
we're saying that there's another way a

459
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,080
path of healing and Reconciliation that

460
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:18,120
doesn't perpetuate cycles of violence

461
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,919
and harm and the amazing thing is this

462
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,679
message has a way of spreading of

463
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,440
inspiring others to choose forgiveness

464
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,039
in their own lives it's like dropping a

465
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,840
pebble into a pond the ripples start

466
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,640
small but they keep growing and

467
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,320
expanding touching everything in their

468
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,000
path we see this ripple effect in action

469
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,440
every time a public figure chooses to

470
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,320
forgive someone who has wronged them or

471
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,520
when a community comes together to heal

472
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,880
after a

473
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,080
tragedy these acts of forgiveness may

474
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,960
start with one person but they have the

475
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,679
power to shift the entire culture

476
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,120
towards greater compassion and

477
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,240
understanding one powerful example of

478
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,240
this is the story of the Forgiveness

479
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,280
project a uk-based organization that

480
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,159
collects share stories of forgiveness

481
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:06,440
from around the world one of their most

482
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:08,679
famous stories is that of azim kamisa a

483
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,760
man whose son was killed by a teenage

484
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:14,360
gang member in a senseless act of

485
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,679
violence despite his unimaginable grief

486
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,080
and anger azim chose to forgive his

487
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,039
son's killer and even reached out to the

488
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,000
young man's grandfather to start a

489
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,679
foundation dedicated to ending youth

490
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
violence through their work azim and his

491
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:30,559
foundation have touched countless lives

492
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,960
inspiring young people to choose

493
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,240
nonviolence and fostering healing and

494
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,559
Reconciliation in communities torn apart

495
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,840
by conflict azim's choice to forgive

496
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,080
didn't just transform his own life it

497
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:46,159
created a ripple effect of compassion

498
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,679
that continues to spread to this day and

499
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:50,520
this is just one example among many from

500
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,840
restorative justice programs that bring

501
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,799
victims and offenders together to heal

502
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,760
to Grassroots movements for peace and

503
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,799
Reconciliation in war torn countries the

504
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,360
power of forgiveness is being harnessed

505
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:05,120
to create real tangible change in the

506
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,120
world so my friends as we continue on

507
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,720
this journey of forgiveness let's not

508
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,240
underestimate the impact that our own

509
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,760
choices can have every time we choose to

510
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,280
forgive to respond with compassion and

511
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,600
understanding we're not just healing

512
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,480
ourselves we're contributing to a global

513
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,080
shift towards a more peaceful more

514
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,440
compassionate world it's not always easy

515
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,679
and it's not always quick but the

516
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,280
Forgiveness ripple effect is real and

517
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,919
it's powerful

518
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,600
and it all starts with us with the

519
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:34,840
simple but revolutionary choice to let

520
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,840
go of our resentment and embrace a new

521
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,360
way of

522
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,799
being so let's dream big my fellow

523
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,760
forgiveness

524
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:43,960
revolutionaries let's imagine a world

525
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,120
where forgiveness is the norm where

526
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,240
conflicts are resolved with empathy and

527
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,600
understanding where cycles of violence

528
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,120
and retaliation are replaced by cycles

529
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,960
of healing and

530
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,559
Reconciliation it may seem like an

531
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,919
Impossible Dream but every great change

532
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,559
starts with a single Ripple the

533
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,559
revolution Starts

534
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,120
Now now it's time to take this journey

535
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,400
to the next level it's time to put all

536
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,480
of our Newfound wisdom and skills into

537
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,400
practice and create some serious

538
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,600
forgiveness momentum out in the world

539
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,840
and that's where the Forgiveness

540
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,400
challenge comes

541
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,559
in here's how it works I challenge each

542
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,200
and every one of you to commit to a

543
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:29,640
daily forgiveness practice for the next

544
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,240
30 30

545
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,320
days it doesn't have to be big or

546
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,720
complicated it can be as simple as

547
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,200
taking a few deep breaths and silently

548
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,559
offering forgiveness to someone who's

549
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,960
hurt you in the past or practicing a

550
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:46,320
loving kindness meditation to cultivate

551
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,000
compassion for yourself and others the

552
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,320
key is to make forgiveness a regular

553
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,120
part of your daily routine like brushing

554
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,720
your teeth or getting in your daily

555
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,360
steps by committing to this practice

556
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,279
you'll be strengthening your forgiveness

557
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:02,400
muscles and creating a powerful habit of

558
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:05,080
letting go and moving

559
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,679
forward and here's the best part you

560
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,240

617
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,600
in well my friends we've reached the end

618
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,760
of our forgiveness journey together and

619
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,720
what a journey it's been we've laughed

620
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,399
we've cried we've faced our deepest

621
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,679
grudges and come out the other side

622
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:41,240
stronger wiser and more compassionate

623
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:43,200
than ever before as I look back on my

624
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,480
own path from Grudge Guru to forgiveness

625
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,200
fanatic I'm filled with a sense of

626
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,520
gratitude and

627
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,279
awe gratitude for the teachings of

628
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,080
forgiveness that have transformed my

629
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,760
life in ways I never could have imagined

630
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,720
and awe at the incredible power we all

631
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:04,000
have within us to Choose Love over fear

632
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,600
peace over conflict Freedom over

633
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,200
resentment but here's the thing my wise

634
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:12,320
and wonderful friends this journey

635
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,360
doesn't end here in fact it's just the

636
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,080
beginning because the real work of

637
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,120
forgiveness doesn't happen in a YouTube

638
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,000
video or a social media post it happens

639
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,520
out there in the world in the choices we

640
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,120
make and the actions we take every

641
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,919
single day so as we come to the end of

642
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,320
our time together I want to leave you

643
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:29,799
with a few parting words of encour

644
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,000
encouragement and

645
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:35,720
inspiration first and foremost remember

646
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,799
that forgiveness is a journey not a

647
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,360
destination it's not about achieving

648
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:41,480
some state of perfect peace and

649
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,799
Tranquility but rather about committing

650
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,320
to the Daily practice of letting go

651
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:48,200
again and again and

652
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,200
again there will be days when

653
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,120
forgiveness feels impossible when the

654
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,159
hurt and anger feel too deep to overcome

655
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,039
but in those moments remember that you

656
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:59,000
have all the tools and wisdom you need

657
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,679
to keep moving forward

658
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,240
remember the power of acknowledging your

659
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:05,520
pain extending empathy and compassion

660
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,760
and making the choice to release your

661
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,039
resentment remember that every small Act

662
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,039
of forgiveness is a victory a step

663
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:15,039
towards your own healing and freedom and

664
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,520
