this story than meets the eye what if

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,720
just maybe Jesus was actually a bodh

36
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,520
satva I know I know it sounds crazy but

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,040

00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,000
two spiritual

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,720
Giants we'll explore the concept of the

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,399
bodhisatwa uncover mindblowing parallels

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,399
in their births and early lives and even

44
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:44,159
dive into the mysteries of resurrection

45
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:45,960
and

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,360
Enlightenment but here's the thing my

47
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,399
fellow wisdom Seekers this isn't just

48
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,680
about comparing two ancient dudes with

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,119
awesome beards it's about finding the

50
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,119
common threads that unite us all in our

51
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,320
quest for meaning purpose and inner

52
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,039
peace because whether you're a Christian

53
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,320
a Buddhist or just a curious soul

54
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,960
searching for answers there's something

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,679
profound to be learned from the wisdom

56
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,440
of these enlightened

57
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:13,080
beings now before we dive in I want to

58
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,959
make one thing crystal clear this video

59
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,519
is not about proving one spiritual

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,480
tradition right or wrong it's not about

61
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,200
trying to convert anyone or challenge

62
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,200
anyone's deeply held

63
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,040
beliefs no my friends this is about

64
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,959
exploring the beauty and wisdom that can

65
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,239
be found in the teachings of both Jesus

66
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,200
and Buddha and how their message might

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,599
just be more connected than we ever

68
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,360
realized our goal is to explore the

69
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:38,519
similarities and Common Ground between

70
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,519
these two great spiritual teachers while

71
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:41,640
respecting and appreciating the distinct

72
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,400
paths they

73
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,560
offer by exploring these parallels we

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,800
hope to foster a spirit of interfaith

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,560
understanding and dialogue recognizing

76
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,640
that there is wisdom to be gained from

77
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,280
engaging with diverse spiritual

78
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,760
perspectives ultimately the aim is to

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,640
celebrate the ways in which Jesus and

80
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,040
Buddha's teachings can Inspire and guide

81
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,239
us in our own lives regardless of our

82
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,159
individual religious or philosophical

83
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,400
backgrounds so I invite you to approach

84
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,920
this topic with an open mind and an open

85
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,920
heart let's celebrate the profound

86
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,080
insights and transformative power of

87
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,840
these two great spiritual teachers and

88
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,680
find the common ground that unites us

89
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,440
all but first let's take a quick look at

90
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,440
who these two legendary figures really

91
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,840
were who's who now I know most of you

92
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,640
are probably familiar with these guys

93
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,080
but humor me for a moment as we take a

94
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:41,680
quick trip down memory lane first up we

95
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:44,720
have Jesus Christ the central figure of

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,400
Christianity born in Bethlehem Jesus was

97
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,599
a Jewish teacher healer and spiritual

98
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,760
leader who preached a message of Love

99
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,599
forgiveness and

100
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,959
salvation his teachings which are

101
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,920
recorded in the New Testament of the

102
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,200
Bible emphasize the importance of Faith

103
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,959
compassion and a personal relation ship

104
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,400
with God Jesus performed countless

105
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,680
miracles from turning water into wine to

106
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,799
Healing The Sick and even raising the

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,799
dead he challenged the religious

108
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,159
authorities of his time and gathered a

109
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:18,079
devoted group of apostles who spread his

110
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,880
message far and wide ultimately Jesus's

111
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,240
life and death on the cross became the

112
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,199
foundation of the Christian faith which

113
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,199
teaches that through his sacrifice

114
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:30,000
Humanity can find Redemption and eternal

115
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,320
life I am the way the truth and and the

116

disillusioned with the fleeting nature

125
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:55,720
of worldly pleasures and set out on a

126

gotama be sure to check out our previous

146
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,199
video where we explore his journey in

147
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Greater detail I'll drop a link in the

148
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,479
description below so you can dive deeper

149
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,759
into the story of the

150
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,880
Buddha but for now let's focus on the

151
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,440
question at hand what do these two

152
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,120
spiritual Giants have in common could

153
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,720
there be a deeper connection between

154
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,440
their lives and

155
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,479
teachings it's a fascinating idea isn't

156
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,840
it two men born in different times and

157
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,360
places both leaving an indelible mark on

158
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,319
the world and the way we understand

159
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,080
ourselves in the universe to answer that

160
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:19,960
we first need to understand a key

161
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,000
Concept in Buddhist thought the Bodhi

162
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,599
satva it's a term that might sound

163
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,800
foreign to some of you but trust me once

164
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:28,479
you grasp its meaning it'll shed a whole

165
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,240
new light on the similarities between

166
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,160
Jesus and Buddha

167
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,560
now I know what you're thinking

168
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,319
bodhisatwa is that some kind of fancy

169
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,919
latte but trust me it's even more

170
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,800
enlightening than your favorite coffee

171
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:42,240
shop

172
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,160
beverage so buckle up my fellow truth

173
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,639
Seekers because we're about to embark on

174
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,319
a journey that will challenge the way

175
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,639
you think about these two spiritual

176
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,000
leaders and the profound wisdom they

177
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,000
have to

178
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,240
offer bodhisatwa

179
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,319
101 so what exactly is a bodhisatwa in

180
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,039
Buddha is thought a bodhisatwa is a

181
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,280
being who has reached a high level of

182
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,720
spiritual enlightenment but chooses to

183
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,520
postpone their own entry into Nirvana In

184
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,000
order to help others achieve Liberation

185
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,280
from suffering they are characterized by

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
their boundless compassion wisdom and

187
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,560
dedication to guiding all beings towards

188
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,840
Enlightenment bodhisattvas are often

189
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,440
depicted as Celestial beings but they

190
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,879
can also be humans who have embarked on

191
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,080
the bodhisatwa

192
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,319
path the bodhisatwa path is a central

193
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,080
Concept in Mahayana Buddhism

194
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,680
which emphasizes the importance of

195
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,000
compassion and the aspiration to attain

196
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,319
buddhahood for the benefit of all

197
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,280
sentient

198
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,080
beings those who follow this path commit

199
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,319
themselves to cultivating the six

200
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:51,120
Perfections generosity ethics patience

201
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,840
diligence meditation and wisdom by

202
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,680
mastering these qualities and engaging

203
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,639
in selfless acts of service bodhisattvas

204
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,520
work tirelessly to alleviate the

205
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:00,759
suffering of others and guide them

206
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,120
towards Spiritual

207
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:04,639
Awakening abodh satva is not only

208
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,759
concerned with their own spiritual

209
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,199
progress but dedicate their lives to

210
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:11,440
guiding others towards Enlightenment

211
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,639
they willingly postpone their own entry

212
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,080
into Nirvana until all beings have been

213
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,000
freed from the cycle of death and

214
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,720
rebirth now you might be wondering what

215
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,840
does all of this have to do with Jesus

216
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,960
well that's where things get really

217
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,639
interesting when we look at the life and

218
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,280
teachings of Jesus Through the lens of

219
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:33,279
the bodhisatwa ideal some fascinating

220
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,519
parallels begin to emerge but before we

221
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,560
dive into that I want to let you know

222
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,719
that my good friend Peter is planning to

223
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,479
dedicate an entire video to exploring

224
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:45,080
the bodhisatwa path in Greater depth so

225
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,760
if you're curious to learn more about

226
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,200
this profound spiritual concept be sure

227

to keep an eye out for his upcoming

228
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,519
video I'll make sure to link it in the

229
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,519
description once it's

230
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,600
released for now let's focus on how

231
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,839
Jesus embodied many of the key character

232
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,360
istics of abodh SATA from his

233
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,399
compassionate actions to his ultimate

234
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,800
sacrifice for the sake of

235
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,519
humanity we'll also explore some of the

236
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,800
remarkable similarities between the

237
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,920
birth stories and early lives of Jesus

238
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,000
and Buddha which have led some Scholars

239
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,920
to suggest a deeper connection between

240
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,079
these two spiritual

241
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,279
Giants keep the bodhisatwa ideal in

242
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:27,360
mind you might just find that it sheds

243
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,399
new light on the power of compassion

244
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,360
selflessness and the potential for

245
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,360
Spiritual Awakening that lies within us

246
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,040
all the early lives of Jesus and

247
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,839
Buddha while Jesus and Buddha lived in

248
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,440
different times and places the accounts

249
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,160
of their Origins and formative years

250
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,040
share some remarkable similarities both

251
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,959
Jesus and Buddha are said to have had

252
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,279
miraculous births according to Christian

253
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,040
tradition Jesus was born to the Virgin

254
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,040
Mary through the power of the Holy

255
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,959
Spirit similarly Buddhist scriptures

256
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,640
tell us that Buddha's mother Queen Maya

257
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,399
conceived him after dreaming of a white

258
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,120
elephant entering her side these

259
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,680
extraordinary birth narrative set the

260
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,680
stage for the exceptional lives that

261
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,120
would follow I guess you could say they

262
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,079
were both Born to Be

263
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,760
Stars moreover both Jesus and Buddha's

264
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,399
births were accompanied by signs and

265
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,519
prophecies that foretold their greatness

266
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,120
in the biblical account the Wise Men

267
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,959
followed a star to find the Infant Jesus

268
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,480
while the prophet Simeon declared that

269
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,399
he would be be a light to the

270
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,079
Nations likewise when Buddha was born it

271
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,440
is said that a great Seer named AA

272
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,959
predicted that he would either become a

273
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,920
great king or a spiritual leader who

274
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,560
would Enlighten the world interestingly

275
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,880
both Jesus and Buddha were born into

276
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,240
Royal lineages although there is some

277
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,160
debate among Scholars about the

278
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,160
historical accuracy of these claims the

279
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,600
Bible presents Jesus as a descendant of

280
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,600
King David but there is no scholarly

281
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,000
consensus on this point Buddha on the

282
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,120
other hand was indeed a prince of the

283
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,399
shakya clan according to Buddhist

284
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,839
tradition despite their purportedly

285
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,920
privileged backgrounds both men

286
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,800
ultimately renounced worldly life in

287
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,600
pursuit of a higher calling Jesus left

288
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,880
his home to preach the gospel and

289
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,600
challenge the religious establishment

290
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,000
while Buddha famously abandoned his

291
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,800
Palace to seek spiritual enlightenment

292
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,160
and find a way to end human

293
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,639
suffering both Jesus and Buddha taught

294
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,839
the importance of Detachment from

295
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,959
worldly possessions and the impermanence

296
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:32,519
of life

297
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,880
as Buddha said the world is afflicted by

298
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,639
death and Decay but the wise do not

299
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,839
grieve having realized the nature of the

300
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,600
world similarly Jesus taught do not

301
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,720
store up for yourselves Treasures on

302
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,040
Earth where moths and Vermin destroy and

303
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,399
where thieves break in and

304
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,560
steal these striking parallels in the

305
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,160
early lives of Jesus and Buddha have led

306
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,839
some Scholars to speculate about a

307
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,240
possible historical connection between

308
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,480
the two figures while there's no

309
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,880
conclusive evidence to support this

310
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,240
Theory it's fascinating to consider how

311
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,720
these common themes of miraculous births

312
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,000
prophetic signs and the renunciation of

313
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,880
worldly life have shaped the narratives

314
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,279
surrounding these two spiritual leaders

315
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,279
but the similarities don't end

316
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,199
there great minds think

317
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,440
alike despite the differences in their

318
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,880
cultural and historical contexts these

319
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,519
two spiritual leaders shared some

320
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,720
remarkable similarities in the core

321
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,440
messages they conveyed to their

322
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,880
followers

323
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,440
first and foremost both Jesus and Buddha

324
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,519
placed a strong emphasis on compassion

325
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,959
and love for all

326
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,279
beings Jesus taught his disciples to

327
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,800
love your neighbor as yourself and to

328
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,959
extend forgiveness and kindness even to

329
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,680
their

330
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:50,880
enemies similarly Buddha's teachings

331
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,199
were rooted in the concept of meta or

332
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,639
Universal loving kindness which calls

333
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:57,880
for cultivating compassion and Good Will

334
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,720
towards all sensient beings without

335
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,440
exception

336
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,279
Jesus and Buddha both emphasized the

337
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,240
transformative power of love and

338
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,519
compassion Buddha encouraged his

339
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,680
followers to radiate boundless love

340
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,720
towards the entire world while Jesus

341
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,760
told his disciples as I have loved you

342
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,839
so you must love one

343
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,000
another these quotes highlight the

344
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,440
central role of love in their teachings

345
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,760
and the importance of extending

346
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,079
compassion to all beings moreover both

347
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,360
Jesus and Buddha stressed the importance

348
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,760
of inner transformation and spiritual

349
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,720
awakening

350
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,040
Jesus spoke of the need to be born again

351
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,320
in the spirit and to seek the kingdom of

352
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,440
God within

353
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,959
oneself likewise Buddha's teachings

354
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,480
centered on the idea of Enlightenment or

355
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,680
the realization of one's true nature and

356
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,199
The Liberation from the cycle of

357
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,519
suffering both Masters encouraged their

358
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:53,079
followers to look Beyond external

359
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,000
appearances and to cultivate a deep

360
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:57,160
transformative connection with the

361
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,480
Divine as a Fletcher straightens an

362
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,199
arrow shaft even so the discern man

363
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:06,639
straightens his mind so fickle and

364
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:07,680
unsteady so difficult to guard dapada

clean Matthew

369
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,000
23:26 it's like they were reading each

370
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,720
other's minds across time and space talk

371
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,720
about a cosmic

372
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,920
connection interestingly both Jesus and

373
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,839
Buddha were also known for challenging

374
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,639
the social norms in Rel religious dogmas

375
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,880
of their times Jesus famously critiqued

376
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,240
the hypocrisy of the religious leaders

377
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,639
and defied conventions by associating

378
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,560
with outcasts and marginalized

379
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:45,079
groups similarly Buddha rejected the

380
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,880
rigid cast system of ancient India and

381
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:49,480
taught that one's spiritual worth was

382
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,839
not determined by birth or social status

383
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,320
but by one's actions and inner

384
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,839
qualities another striking similarity

385
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,040
between Jesus and Buddha's teaching

386
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,320
methods was their use of Parables and

387
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,399
storytelling to convey profound

388
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,440
spiritual

389
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:06,120
truths Jesus often spoke in Parables

390
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,000
using everyday examples and vivid

391
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,759
imagery to illustrate his points about

392
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,560
the kingdom of God and the way of

393
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:15,120
righteousness likewise Buddha employed

394
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,360
stories and allegories to make his

395
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,959
teachings more accessible and memorable

396
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,279
such as the famous tale of the mustard

397
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,440
seed that illustrates the universality

398
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,639
of suffering and

399
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,800
impermanence it's truly remarkable to

400
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:30,160
see how these two spiritual Giants

401
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,040
separated by time and culture shared

402
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,680
such similar approaches to teaching and

403
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,319
transforming the hearts and minds of

404
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,319
their followers their emphasis on

405
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:41,560
compassion Inner Awakening social reform

406
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:43,519
and the power of Storytelling speaks to

407
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,920
the Timeless and Universal nature of

408
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,480
their wisdom as renowned Buddhist

409
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,480
scholar and author tiut hun notes when

410
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,920
you are a truly happy Christian you're

411
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,519
also a Buddhist and vice

412
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,920
versa the insights of respected figures

413
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,120
like tatan who have deeply studied and

414
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,920
practiced in both tradition s add weight

415
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,990
to the idea that the core teachings of

416
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,920
Jesus and Buddha share a profound Common

417
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:10,399
[Music]

418
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,920
Ground the power of pain perhaps one of

419
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,040
the most profound parallels between

420
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,319
these two great teachers lies in their

421
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,000
understanding of the role of suffering

422
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:20,839
and sacrifice in the journey toward

423
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Enlightenment for Jesus the ultimate

424
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,160
expression of this principle was his

425
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,120
willingness to endure the agony of the

426
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,800
crucifixion according to Christian

427
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,600
teachings Jesus's death on the cross was

428
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,839
a supreme Act of

429
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,680
self-sacrifice undertaken for the

430
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,839
Salvation of

431
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,680
humanity by bearing the sins of the

432
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:43,680
world and surrendering his life Jesus

433
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,199
demonstrated the transformative power of

434
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,440
suffering when it is embraced with love

435
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,440
and

436
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,759
compassion similarly Buddha's path to

437
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,160
Enlightenment was marked by a period of

438
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,040
intense asceticism during which he

439
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,079
subjected himself to extreme physical

440
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,839
deprivation and hardship although he

441
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:04,839
ultimately rejected this approach as a

442
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,120
means to spiritual

443
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,319
Liberation Buddha's willingness to push

444
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,360
himself to the limits of human endurance

445
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:15,000
underscores the idea that suffering when

446
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,839
approached with mindfulness and equinity

447
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,439
can be a powerful Catalyst for inner

448
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,880
growth and

449
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,919
transformation in both cases the

450
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,280
suffering and sacrifices endured by

451
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,799
Jesus and Buddha were not seen as ends

452
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,840
in themselves but as means to a higher

453
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:32,679
spiritual purpose

454
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,480
by willingly embracing pain and hardship

455
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:36,000
these two great teachers demonstrated

456
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,799
the transformative power of

457
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,080
self-sacrifice and the ability to

458
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:43,559
transcend the limitations of the ego in

459
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,000
service of a greater good moreover their

460
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,679
examples have inspired countless

461
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,039
followers throughout the ages to find

462
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,400
meaning and purpose in their own

463
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:52,799
struggles and challenges by viewing

464
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,640
suffering not as a punishment or a curse

465
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,039
but as an opportunity for growth and

466
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,440
Awakening we can follow in the footsteps

467
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,000
of these spiritual pioneers and discover

468
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,600
the hidden blessings within our own

469
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,600
trials and

470
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,440
tribulations the stories of Jesus and

471
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,440
Buddha remind us that the path to True

472
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,640
wisdom and Enlightenment is rarely an

473
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,039
easy one it often requires us to

474
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,080
confront our deepest fears to let go of

475
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,480
our attachments and to be willing to

476
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,440
sacrifice our own comfort and desires

477
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,720
for the sake of a higher

478
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,120
truth but as we'll see in the next part

479
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,360
of our video the rewards of this path

480
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:32,039
are beyond measure for in the end both

481
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,480
Jesus and Buddha promise us a glimpse of

482
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:35,919
something far greater than our

483
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:39,679
individual selves a vision of the

484
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,679
Eternal the infinite and the

485
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:47,200
Divine Miracles magic and mind-blowing

486
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,840
Feats some of the most striking

487
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,159
parallels can be found in the stories of

488
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,120
their miraculous actions and

489
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,200
supernatural abilities Jesus and Buddha

490
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,280
both valued generosity and selfless

491
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,559
giving Buddha taught if you knew the

492
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,640
power of generosity you would not let a

493
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:06,520
single Meal Pass without sharing it in a

494
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,760
similar vein Jesus said it is more

495
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,919
blessed to give than to

496
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,679
receive both Jesus and Buddha were

497
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,159
renowned for their ability to heal the

498
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:17,039
sick and The Afflicted the gospels are

499
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:19,559
filled with accounts of Jesus restoring

500
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:23,000
sight to the blind cleansing lepers and

501
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:24,840
even raising the dead similarly Buddhist

502
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,080
scriptures recount numerous instances of

503
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,679
Buddha using his spiritual powers to

504
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,640
cure the ill and alleviate the suffering

505
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:33,679
uing of those around him another common

506
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,880
theme in the stories of Jesus and Buddha

507
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,760
is their ability to miraculously provide

508
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,280
food for the hungry in one of the most

509
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,559
famous episodes from the gospels Jesus

510
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,919
is said to have fed a multitude of 5,000

511
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:47,039
people with just five loaves of bread

512
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,960
and two

513
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,480
fish likewise Buddhist Legends tell of

514
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,240
Buddha and his disciples receiving

515
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,200
offerings of food from the villages they

516
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,159
visited which would miraculously

517
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,840
multiply to sustain them on their

518
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:01,240
Journeys

519
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,120
perhaps most intriguingly both Jesus and

520
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,080
Buddha are said to have demonstrated

521
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,120
Mastery over the physical world in ways

522
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,679
that defy ordinary human

523
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,640
abilities the gospels famously recount

524
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,799
how Jesus walked on the water of the Sea

525
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,440
of Galilee demonstrating his power over

526
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,440
the

527
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,200
elements similarly Buddhist scriptures

528
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,200
describe Buddha and his disciples

529
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,880
levitating during meditation

530
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,240
transcending the Earthly realm through

531
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,240
the power of their spiritual attainment

532
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,880
now as modern rational thinkers we may

533
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,320
be tempted to dismiss these stories as

534
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,080
mere Legends or

535
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,600
exaggerations but what if there's a

536
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,679
deeper truth hidden Within These

537
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,559
miraculous accounts what if they're

538
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,919
meant to be read not as literal

539
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:45,559
historical events but as powerful

540
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,159
symbolic representations of the

541
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:50,840
transformative power of Spiritual

542
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,240
Awakening perhaps the true Miracle of

543
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,679
Jesus and Buddha was not their ability

544
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,640
to defy the laws of physics but their

545
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,159
capacity to heal the deepest wounds of

546
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,320
the human heart to nourish the hunger of

547
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,440
the soul and to help us rise above the

548
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,360
limitations of our Earthly

549
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,559
existence when we examine Jesus life and

550
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,200
teachings through the lens of the

551
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:14,320
bodhisatwa ideal several key examples

552
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,480
Stand Out jesus' emphasis on love

553
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,000
forgiveness and selfless service aligns

554
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,120
closely with the bodhisattva's

555
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,760
compassionate

556
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,440
nature his willingness to sacrifice his

557
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,520
own life for the Salvation of humanity

558
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,200
can be seen as a powerful expression of

559
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,039
the bodh sata's Comm commitment to

560
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,080
putting others well-being before their

561
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:37,400
own in Mahayana Buddhist texts such as

562
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,640
the Lotus Sutra there are references to

563
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,919
the concept of Buddha nature the idea

564
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,080
that all beings have the potential for

565
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,159
enlightenment some Scholars have drawn

566
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,919
parallels between this concept and

567
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,679
Jesus's teachings on the kingdom of God

568

being within each person this shared

569
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,000
emphasis on the Divine potential within

570
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:59,230
all beings is another point of resonance

571
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,960
between Jesus and the bodhisatwa ideal

[Music]

573
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,080
rising from the dead and waking up to

574
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,279
reality here we come to perhaps the most

575
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,760
profound and mysterious aspect of their

576
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:15,159
stories the concept of resurrection and

577
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,760
Enlightenment in the Christian tradition

578
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:18,679
the resurrection of Jesus is the

579
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,360
defining moment that sets him apart from

580
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:23,919
all other spiritual teachers according

581
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,240
to the gospels after being crucified and

582
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,960
buried Jesus rose from the dead on the

583
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,159
third day conquering death itself and

584
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,039
offering the promise of eternal life to

585
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:35,880
all who believe in him this miraculous

586
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:37,960
event is seen as the ultimate proof of

587
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,799
Jesus's divine nature and the

588
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,720
Cornerstone of Christian faith in the

589
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,919
Buddhist tradition the parallel to

590
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,840
Jesus's resurrection is the moment of

591
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:48,000
Buddha's

592
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,520
Enlightenment after years of seeking and

struggle sidartha gatama finally

594
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,200

Spiritual Awakening and Liberation from

596
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,480
the cycle of death and rebirth this

597
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,559
transformative experience is said to

00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,440
have occurred as he sat in meditation

599
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:06,840
under the bod tree finally realizing the

600
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,520
true nature of reality and the path to

601
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,159
end all

602
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,600
suffering at first glance these two

603
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,720
events may seem quite different one a

604
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,840
physical Resurrection from the dead the

605
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,640
other A Spiritual Awakening and

606
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,919
realization but at their core both the

607
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,279
resurrection and Enlightenment represent

608
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:29,279
a profound victory over the ultimate

609
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:31,520
human fears death and suffering in both

610
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,520
cases Jesus and Buddha offer us a

611
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,960
glimpse of a reality beyond the confines

612
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,440
of our mortal existence they point us

613
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,400
towards a higher truth a deeper

614
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,840
understanding of the nature of life and

615
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,919
the possibility of transcending our

616
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,720
Earthly

617
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,000
limitations whether it's through the

618
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,960
promise of eternal life in heaven or the

619
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,520
attainment of Nirvana and Liberation

620
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,440
from the cycle of rebirth both of these

621
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,679
great spiritual teachers offer us a

622
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,440
vision of Hope and

623
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:01,880
transformation that has inspired

624
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,880
generations of seekers across the

625
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,279
world apples and oranges debunking the

626
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,279
differences between Jesus and

627
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,440
Buddha it's important to acknowledge

628
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,840
that despite these similarities there

629
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,480
are also significant differences between

630
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,559
these two great spiritual figures rooted

631
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,399
in the unique historical and cultural

632
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:26,600
contexts of their lives and

633
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:28,039
teachings one of the key distinctions

634
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,399
lies in the central role that Faith

635
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:32,640
plays in Jesus's teachings for

636
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:35,080
Christians salvation is achieved not

637
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,159
through one's own efforts or Good Deeds

638
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,399
but through faith in Jesus as the Son of

639
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,720
God and the savior of

640
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:44,000
humanity this emphasis on Grace and

641
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,919
divine intervention sets Christianity

642
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,399
apart from the more self-directed path

643
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,200
of spiritual practice and realization

644
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:52,520
found in Buddhism on the other hand

645
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,880
Buddhist teachings are centered around

646
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,760
the four noble truths the reality of

647
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,919
suffering its cause its cessation and

648
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,760
the path to

649
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,240
Liberation this pragmatic and

650
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,720
psychological approach to spirituality

651
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,039
focuses on the individual's own actions

652
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,279
and states of Mind as the key to

653
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:13,320
Enlightenment rather than Reliance on an

654
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:15,080
external savior figure the Buddhist path

655
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,120
is one of self-discovery and personal

656
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,159
transformation through meditation

657
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,000
mindfulness and the cultivation of

658
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:23,600
wisdom and

659
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,480
compassion moreover it's crucial to

660
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,960
recognize that Jesus and Buddha lived in

661
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,640
vastly different times and places each

662
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,440
with its own own unique cultural social

663
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,000
and religious context Jesus's teachings

664
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,279
emerged within the monotheistic

665
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,320
tradition of Judaism in Roman occupied

666
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,919
Israel while Buddha's teachings

667
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,960
developed within the diverse religious

668
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,200
landscape of ancient India which

669
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,679
included Hinduism gism and various

670
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,039
athetic Traditions these different

671
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:52,760
contexts undoubtedly shape the way each

672
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,600
of these great teachers articulated

673
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,159
their spiritual insights and the

674
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,679
specific challenges they faced in

675
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,799
spreading their message but believe

676
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:03,600
nothing no matter where you read it or

677
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,600
who said it no matter if I have said it

678
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,640
unless it agrees with your own reason

679
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,279
and your own Common Sense kalas sua

680
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,720
render to Caesar the things that are

681
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,720
Caesars and to God the things that are

682
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,080
Gods Mark

683
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,159
12:17 some may argue that applying the

684
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,000
concept of bodhisatwa which emerged

685
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:26,600
within the Buddhist tradition to Jesus a

686
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,080
central figure in Christianity risks

687
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,559
oversimplifying or misre presenting both

688
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,039
spiritual

689
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,120
Traditions furthermore while Jesus and

690
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,399
the bodhisatwa ideal share many common

691
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,240
qualities there are also significant

692
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:40,640
differences in their ultimate goals and

693
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,399
the ways in which they are understood

694
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,799
within their respective religious

695
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:47,120
Frameworks for Christians Jesus is seen

696
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:50,559
as the unique Son of God and the savior

697
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,520
of humanity whereas the bodhisatwa is a

698
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,679
spiritual archetype that any being can

699
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,559
aspire to

700
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,360
embody ultimately while the similarities

701
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,799
between Jesus and Buddha are striking

702
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,679
and thought-provoking it's important not

703
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,520
to overlook the unique and valuable

704
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:07,600
contributions that each of these great

705
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,039
spiritual teachers made to the world

706
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,039
each offers us a different path to

707
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,679
Awakening a different set of tools and

708
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,799
practices for navigating the challenges

709
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:18,240
of The Human Experience and connecting

710
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:20,080
with a higher truth in the end perhaps

711
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,200
the greatest lesson we can take from the

712
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,200
stories of Jesus and Buddha is the

713
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,360
recognition that despite our differences

714
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,360
we are all Seekers of wisdom compassion

715
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,480
and

716
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,720
Liberation whether we find our path

717
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,640
through faith or through

718
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,559
self-realization the ultimate goal is

719
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,840
the same to awaken to our true nature to

720
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:43,840
live with love and purpose and to help

721
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,840
create a world of Greater peace and

722
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,279
understanding what if Jesus was a

723
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,559
bodhisatwa as we come to the final part

724
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:54,080
of our exploration of Jesus and Buddha I

725
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,640
want to return to the concept we

726
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,399
discussed earlier the bodhisatwa ideal

727
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,559
this powerful archetype from Buddhist

728
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:03,159
tradition offers a fascinating lens

729
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:05,720
through which to view the life and

730
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:07,320
teachings of Jesus revealing a deeper

731
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,760
connection between these two great

732
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,039
spiritual

733
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,080
figures when we look closely at the way

734
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,679
Jesus lived and taught it's hard not to

735
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,880
see the qualities of a bodis SATA

736
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:20,720
shining through like the bodhisatwa

737
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,919
Jesus was a being of infinite compassion

738
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,080
deeply moved by the suffering of others

739
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,799
and dedicated to alleviating their pain

740
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,880
he reached out to the marginalized and

741
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:32,279
the oppressed treating all beings with

742
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,279
equal love and respect regardless of

743
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:38,120
their social status or past actions

744
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,240
moreover we can see in Jesus's life a

745
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,080
powerful example of the Bodhi sata's

746
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,120
willingness to delay their own

747
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,200
Enlightenment for the sake of

748
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:49,919
others in the Garden of Gethsemane as he

749
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,039
faced the prospect of his own death

750
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,799
Jesus prayed for the strength to carry

751
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:57,240
out his mission of love and sacrifice

752
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,960
putting the needs of humanity before his

753
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,640
own personal

754
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,720
Liberation this selfless act mirrors the

755
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,960
bodhisattva's vow to postpone their own

756
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,760
entry into Nirvana until all beings have

757
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,440
been freed from suffering perhaps most

758
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,399
importantly Jesus embodied the

759
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,840
bodhisattva's path of compassionate

760
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,200
service he didn't just teach about love

761
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,919
and compassion he lived it in every

762
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,080
moment through acts of healing

763
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,159
forgiveness and humble

764
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,960
service from washing the feet of his

765
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,120
disciples to giving his own life on the

766
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,360
cross Jesus demonstrated the true me

767
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,120
meaning of bodhichitta the awakened

768
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,519
heart that puts the welfare of others

769
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:38,039
above all else when we see Jesus Through

770
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,559
the lens of the bodhisatwa ideal it

771
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:42,000
becomes clear that his life and

772
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:45,159
teachings were not just about personal

773
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,600
salvation or individual Enlightenment

774
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,519
they were a call to action a challenge

775
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,080
to each of us to embody The Same Spirit

776
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,679
of compassion selflessness and service

777
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,039
that he modeled so perfectly whether we

778
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:59,240
identify as Christians Buddhists or

779
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,240
simply Seekers of Truth truth and wisdom

780
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,480
the example of Jesus as a bodhisatwa

781
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,440
figure has the power to inspire and

782
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,480
transform us it reminds us that true

783
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,919
spiritual greatness is not about what we

784
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,360
believe or what we know but about how we

785
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,200
love how we serve and how we work to

786
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:21,200
create a world of Greater peace Justice

787
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,200
and Awakening for all

788
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,480
beings I hope you've been as inspired

789
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:29,240
and intrigued as I have by the

790
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,159
incredible similarities and differences

791
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,760
between these two great spiritual

792
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:36,159
teachers from their miraculous births

793
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,960
and early lives to their transformative

794
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,360
teachings and Powerful examples of

795
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,159
compassion and selflessness Jesus and

796
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,440
Buddha have left an indelible mark on

797
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,799
the world shaping the spiritual and

798
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,600
moral imaginations of billions of people

799
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:52,039
across history whether you see Jesus as

800
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,120
a bodhisatwa figure or simply as a great

801
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:56,720
teacher and embodiment of love and

802
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,240
wisdom there is no denying the profound

803
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,120
impact he has had on the human and

804
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,399
spirit and in the same way whether you

805
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,799
view Buddha as a spiritual revolutionary

806
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:07,120
or a guide to Inner Peace and

807
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,120
Enlightenment his teachings continue to

808
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,760
inspire and transform lives to this day

809
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,760
as we reflect on the lives and teachings

810
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,480
of Jesus and Buddha we are reminded of

811
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,679
the Timeless wisdom they shared Buddha

812
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,279
once said the only real failure in life

813
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,440
is not to be true to the best one knows

814
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:26,320
while Jesus asked what good will it be

815
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,919
for someone to gain the whole world yet

816
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,000
forfeit their soul these quotes

817
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:32,480
encourage us to seek spiritual truth and

818
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,440
live in alignment with our deepest

819
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,840
values even in the face of life's

820
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,440
challenges and

821
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,919
Temptations in the end perhaps the

822
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,960
greatest lesson we can take from the

823
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,840
stories of Jesus and Buddha is that the

824
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,399
path to True wisdom happiness and

825
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,919
Liberation is not found in any one

826
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:53,279
religion or belief system but in the

827
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:56,039
Universal values of compassion

828
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,399
selflessness and service to

829
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:00,639
others as we Face the challenges and

830
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,559
uncertainties of our own time may we all

831
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:05,080
draw strength and inspiration from the

832
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,559
examples of these two great spiritual

833
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,480
Pioneers may we strive to embody their

834
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:12,919
teachings of Love wisdom and Awakening

835
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,159
in our own lives and work to create a

836
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:17,080
world where all beings can find peace

837
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:19,360
purpose and

838
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,720
Liberation in a world that often feels

839
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,840
divided and conflicted the teachings of

840
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,440

841
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,360
us a way forward a path of unity

842
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
understanding

843
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,200
and

844
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,360
Love by embodying the bodhisatwa ideal

845
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,919
by embracing the transformative power of

846
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,799
compassion and wisdom we can each become

847
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,679
a Force for healing and Awakening in our

848
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:46,840

us so let us take up this challenge let

00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,639

Liberation this is the great work of our

855
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,399
time time and it begins with each one of

856
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:02,399
us here and

857
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:09,279

858
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:11,440
and insights we've explored in this

859
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,200
video I invite you to take a moment to

860
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,639
reflect on how you can embody the spirit

861
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,320
of the bodhisatwa in your own

862
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:19,919
life what small acts of compassion and

863
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,639
service can you offer to those around

864
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,039
you how can you cultivate a heart of

865
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:27,600
wisdom and Awakening even in the midst

866
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,639
of life's challenges and distractions

867
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,840
and and hey if you're feeling really

868
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:34,559
ambitious you could even try meditating

869
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,799
under a bod tree until you reach

870
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,600
Enlightenment just don't forget to pack

871
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:42,320
some snacks in a comfortable

872
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,519
cushion but in all seriousness

873
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,080
cultivating a heart of wisdom and

874
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:51,120
Awakening is no easy feat especially

875
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,960
when life throws us curveballs and

876
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,600
distractions but remember even the

877
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,440
greatest spiritual leaders had their

878
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,639
moments of doubt and frustration

879
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,200

880
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:04,480
