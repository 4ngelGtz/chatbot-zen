2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,200
hey there truth Seekers and wisdom

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,440
enthusiasts welcome back to Buddha's

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,400
wisdom I'm Peter and today we're diving

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,480
into a topic that's not just profound

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,119
but has the power to revolutionize the

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,640
way we live and interact with the world

8
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,439
around us we're talking about the

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,480
bodhisatwa path a Cornerstone of

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,200
Buddhist philosophy that's more relevant

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,320
today than ever

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,480
before imagine a world where every

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,640
single person is driven by an unwavering

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,879
commitment to compassion wisdom and

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,800
selflessness a world where people wake

16
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:49,320
up each day with one primary goal to

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,480
serve others and alleviate suffering

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,960
sounds like a Utopia right well this is

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,120
the essence of the bodhisatwa path and

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,320
believe it or not it's a way of life

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,120
that's accessible to each and every one

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,600
of us

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,519
but what exactly is a bodhisatwa in

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,000
simple terms a bodhisatwa is an

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,560
enlightened being who makes a conscious

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,400
choice to postpone their own ultimate

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,720
Liberation what Buddhists call

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,159
Nirvana In order to guide and serve

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,880
others on their path to Awakening it's

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,759
like having the winning lottery ticket

31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,200
but choosing not to cash it in until

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,360
everyone else has won too pretty radical

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,479
huh now I know what you might be

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,040
thinking Peter this sounds great and all

35
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,799
but how does does this apply to me I'm

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,960
just trying to get through my day-to-day

37
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:39,000
life pay my bills and maybe squeeze in a

38
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,960
bit of Netflix and that's exactly why we

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,560
need to talk about this the beauty of

40
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,000
the bodhisatwa path is that it's not

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,360
some lofty unattainable ideal reserved

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,439
for monks meditating in Himalayan caves

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,840
it's a practical framework for personal

44
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,320
growth self-improvement and ultimately

45
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,920
for creating a more peaceful and

46
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,200
harmonious World starting right with

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,200
where you

48
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,080
are the bodhisatwa ideal has deep roots

49
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:11,080
in Buddhist history specifically in the

50
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,480
Mahayana tradition Mahayana Buddhism

51
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:17,120
emerged around the 1 Century CE about

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,480
500 years after the historical Buddha

53
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,239
sidartha gaama lived and taught this new

54
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,440
movement brought with it some

55
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:29,560
revolutionary ideas and the Bodhi satva

56
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,080
concept was Chief among them in early

57
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,519
buddh M the primary goal was individual

58
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,120
Liberation from

59
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,599
suffering practitioners aimed to become

60
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,400
arhats enlightened beings who would no

61
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:43,760
longer be reborn into the cycle of

62
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,680
samsara but the Mahayana tradition

63
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,319
introduced a Twist they said Hey what if

64
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,480
instead of just focusing on our own

65
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,319
Liberation we committed to sticking

66
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,319
around until all beings are free from

67
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,319
suffering and boom the bodhisatwa ideal

68
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,440
was born

69
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,640
this shift wasn't just a minor tweak it

70
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,680
was a complete Paradigm change it moved

71
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,400
Buddhism from a path of individual

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,239
salvation to one of universal

73
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,640
compassion the bodhisatwa became the new

74
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,120
ideal embodying the perfect balance of

75
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,560
wisdom and

76
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,519
compassion as this concept evolved over

77
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,599
the centuries it took on different forms

78
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,159
in various cultures in Tibet it became

79
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,879
intertwined with the idea of

80
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,680
reincarnated

81
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:34,360
llamas in China and Japan it manifested

82
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,599
in the popular figure of Guan Yin the

83
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,480
bodhisatwa of

84
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:43,439
compassion and in the

85
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,519
west well that's where things get really

86
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,680
interesting as Buddhism has spread

87
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,159
globally in recent decades the

88
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,599
bodhisatwa ideal has found new relevance

89
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,079
in our interconnected often troubled

90
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,280
world but here's the kicker you don't

91
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:00,760
need to be a card carrying Buddhist to

92
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,840
appreciate or apply the bodhisatwa idea

93
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,200
at its core it's about cultivating

94
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,599
compassion wisdom and a commitment to

95
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,280
helping others and in our world of

96
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,799
rising inequality environmental crisis

97
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,519
and social division couldn't we all use

98
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,519
a bit more of

99
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,840
that let's examine what truly defines a

100
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,120
bodh satva it's not about supernatural

101
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,400
abilities or visible signs of Holiness

102
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,479
the core of a bodh satva consists of

103
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,840
three key qualities compassion wisdom

104
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,919
and

105
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,759
selflessness compassion comes first this

106
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,160
isn't mere sympathy you might feel when

107
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,000
encountering a sad news story

108
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,080
bodhisattva compassion is active

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,560
powerful and

110
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,639
all-encompassing it means truly feeling

111
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,440
others suffering as your own with a

112
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,320
strong motivation to

113
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,360
act picture caring about everyone's

114
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,240
well-being from your closest friend to a

115
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,639
stranger who wronged you as much as you

116
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,479
care about

117
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,880
yourself this exemplifies bodhisatwa

118
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,880
level

119
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,680
compassion wisdom follows this

120
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,479
transcends general knowledge or trivia

121
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,600
in the bodhisatwa context wisdom

122
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:25,080
signifies a profound experiential

123
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,919
understanding of reality's nature it

124
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,280
involves seeing through the Illusions

125
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:32,120
causing suffering such as our t ment to

126
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,000
a permanent self or the belief that

127
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,560
external things bring lasting happiness

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,919
this wisdom enables a Bodhi satva to

129
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,120
assist others most effectively

130
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:46,440
addressing the root causes of suffering

131
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,440
rather than just the

132
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,120
symptoms selflessness completes the trio

133
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,720
this aspect truly sets bodhisattvas

134
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,880
apart their actions stem not from

135
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,560
personal gain recognition or even

136
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,840
pursuit of their own

137
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,400
Enlightenment instead a genuine desire

138
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,199
to benefit all beings drives them they

139
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,319
embody the Ultimate Team player in

140
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,960
life's Grand game you might think this

141
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,440
sounds ideal but it's

142
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,759
unrealistic I struggle to remember daily

143
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,639
tasks let alone care for all sentient

144
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:25,720
beings you're right it is an ambitious

145
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,520
goal but the bodhisattva path isn't

146
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,800
about achieving Perfection it's about

147
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,639
choosing a Direction

148
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,120
it's about deciding in each moment to

149
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:39,880
cultivate these qualities as best we

150
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,800
can consider this while we may not

151
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,599
become superheroes we can all be

152
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:48,319
everyday heroes in our own lives by

153
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:50,000
fostering compassion pursuing wisdom and

154
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,599
acting less

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,199
self-centered we transform our lives and

156
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:59,800
positively impact the world around us in

157
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,800
today's world that's truly revolutionary

158
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:05,120
now that we've covered the essence of

159
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,560
aodh satva let's look at some famous

160
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,319

fundamental shift in

282
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,320
perspective it's the genuine desire to

283
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:47,120
achieve enlightenment not for personal

284
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,880

caring so deeply about others that your

286
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,199

everyone else escapes suffering too this

288
00:12:55,199 --> 00:13:00,480
motivation manifests in two forms

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,760
aspirational bod is the initial wish to

290
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,600

others developing bodic isn't simple it

295
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,480
pushes against our typical self-focused

296
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,800
thinking we are asked to extend our

297
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,120
concern Beyond close relationships to

298
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,279

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,559
making more conscious consumer choices

380
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,439
reducing your environmental impact or

381
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,480
standing up against Injustice when you

382
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,839
see

383
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,839
it remember applying the bodhisatwa path

384
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,880
is a lifelong journey it's not about

385
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:29,919
perfection but about continuous effort

386
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:33,000
and growth each small act of kindness

387
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:37,679
each moment of patience each ethical

388
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,480
choice is a step on this path over time

389
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,880
these steps add up to significant

390
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,240
personal transformation and positive

391
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,240
impact on the world around

392
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,160
you walking the bodh SATA path isn't

393
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,760
always smooth sailing let's address some

394
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,200
common challenges and clear up

395
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,360
misconceptions one frequent hurdle is

396
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,679
burnout some mistakenly believe that

397
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,400
being a Bo batva means sacrificing your

398
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:07,240
own well-being entirely this isn't true

399
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:11,280
self-care is crucial you can't pour from

400
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,480
an empty cup balance is key taking care

401
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,440
of yourself enables you to help others

402
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,840
more

403
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,840
effectively another challenge is feeling

404
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,360
overwhelmed by the suffering in the

405
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:26,159
world it's easy to think how can I

406
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:29,559
possibly make a difference remember even

407
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:32,559
small acts matter focus on what you can

408
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:35,960
do not on what you

409
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:38,880
can't every positive action ripples

410
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,120
outward creating more impact than you

411
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,640
might

412
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,840
realize some people misunderstand the

413
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,600
concept of non-attachment thinking it

414
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:51,360
means not caring in reality

415
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,440
non-attachment allows for deeper more

416
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,440
genuine

417
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:59,440
care it's about loving without clinging

418
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,799
helping without expectation

419
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,280
a common misconception is that the bodh

420
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:07,320
sadv path is only for Buddhists in truth

421
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,360
these principles are Universal

422
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,280
compassion wisdom and ethical living are

423
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,440
valuable in any context regardless of

424
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,960
religious

425
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,039
beliefs others might think practicing

426
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:22,200
compassion makes you weak or vulnerable

427
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:25,720
actually true compassion requires great

428
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:29,080
strength it's about skillful action not

429
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,640
passive acceptance of harmful Behavior

430
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,320
some struggle with the idea of

431
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,280
postponing their own Enlightenment to

432
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,240
help

433
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,400
others this stems from a

434
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,360
misunderstanding the process of helping

435
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,640
others is itself the path to

436
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,840
Enlightenment it's not about delay but

437
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,159
about recognizing our

438
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,720
interconnectedness lastly people often

439
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:56,240
think the bodhisatta path is about Grand

440
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,919
heroic acts while these can happen it's

441
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,640
more about consistent every day kindness

442
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,840
and

443
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,120
awareness small acts done with great

444
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,600
love form the core of this

445
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,799
practice recognizing these challenges

446
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,720
and misconceptions can help us navigate

447
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:17,039
the path more skillfully it's normal to

448
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,760
face difficulties there are

449
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,960
opportunities for growth stay patient

450
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,720
with yourself keep learning and remember

451
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:30,080
that every step forward no matter how

452
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,080
small is progress

453
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,039
the bodhisatwa path while Universal in

455
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,640
flavors in different

456
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,559
cultures let's explore how this concept

457
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,120
manifests across various Buddhist

458
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:48,480

465

closely tied to the bodhisatwa

466
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,320
idea these individuals are believed to

467
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,600
choose rebirth to continue their work of

468
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,039
helping

popular deities in Chinese folk religion

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,520
like Thailand and Myanmar where theava

the bodhisattva concept is less Central

488

however the ideal of compassionate

489
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,080
action remains crucial often focused on

490
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,720

our own cultural background and personal

512
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,760
confined to ancient texts or Temple

issues but you don't need to be a famous

532
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,760
spiritual leader to walk this path

533
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,120

the bodhisatwa spirit in their own

560
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,080
ways these modern-day examples show us

561
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,799
that the bodhisatwa path isn't an

562
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:22,799
abstract ideal but a living breathing

563
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:25,080
