established historical facts we're

online what we're about to discuss is

48
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,240
speculation based on various sources

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,560
some not accepted by mainstream

conclusions respecting diverse beliefs

55
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,920
and promoting understanding is key if

56
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,120
this topic grabs you consider it a

57
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,800
starting point for further learning not

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,800
a definitive

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,239
answer chapter 1

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,519
The Missing Years of

61
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,800
Jesus all right let's set the stage for

62
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,120
our historical mystery we're talking

63
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,239
about Jesus of Nazareth the central

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,280
figure of

65
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,319
Christianity the gospels give us a

66
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,200
detailed account of Jesus's birth and

67
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,440
early childhood we hear about the manger

68
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,239
the wise men and even a 12-year-old

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,080
Jesus impressing Scholars at the temple

70
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,519
Luke

71
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,360
24647 tells us after 3 days they found

72
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,280
him in the temple courts sitting among

73
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,680
the teachers listening to to them and

74
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,360
asking them questions everyone who heard

75
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,120
him was amazed at his understanding and

76
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,159
his

77
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,200
answers but then radio silence it's like

78
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:15,360
someone hit the pause button on Jesus's

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,879
story we go from this Prodigy kid to

80
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,000
nothing zip

81
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:23,599
NADA the gospels skip ahead and suddenly

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,200
we're dealing with a 30-year-old Jesus

83
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,000
fast forward about 18 years and Jesus is

84
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,239
back on the scene he's getting baptized

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,879
by John in the River Gathering disciples

86
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,599
and kicking off his ministry Matthew

87
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,680
3:13 picks up the story then Jesus Came

88
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,319
From Galilee to the Jordan to be

89
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,360
baptized by John but what about those

90
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,040
Missing

91
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,280
Years that's a long time to be off the

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,799
grid especially for someone so

93
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,360
important this Gap in Jesus's timeline

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,920
has puzzled Scholars theologians and

95
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,519
curious minds for centuries we're

96
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,480
talking about the formative years of his

97
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,920
life

98
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,680
his teens and 20s for most of us that's

99
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,200
when we figure out who we are and what

100
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,360
we want to do with our lives it's when

101
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,640
we form our beliefs challenge our

102
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,680
assumptions and start to see the world

103
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,600
differently so what was Jesus up to

104
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,600
during this crucial

105
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:26,919
period chapter 2 the Buddhist connection

106
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,440
Theory now here's where things get

107
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,840
really interesting some people suggest

108
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,960
that during these Lost Years Jesus might

109
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,280
have traveled far beyond the borders of

110
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,240
Judea they proposed that he journeyed

111
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,919
East possibly as far as India where he

112
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,520
encountered Buddhist teachings and

113
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:46,479
philosophy I know what you're thinking

114
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,120
Jesus in India come on Matt it sounds

115
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,320
like the plot of a Dan Brown novel right

116
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,600
but hang on because this Theory isn't as

117
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,039
new or as crazy as you might think it's

118
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,919
been around for over a century and while

119
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:00,280
it's certainly not mainstream it's

120
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,280
captured the imagination of many SCH and

121
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,560
spiritual

122
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,960
Seekers this Theory first hit the scene

123
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,600
in a big way back in

124
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,400
1894 a Russian journalist named Nicholas

125
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,440
novich claimed he'd found ancient

126
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,000
Tibetan Scrolls that told the story of

127
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,919
St Issa supposedly another name for

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Jesus according to novich these Scrolls

129
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:24,039
described isa's journey to India and his

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,919
studies there of course nich's claims

131
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:28,840
were met with more than a few raised

132
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,479
eyebrows many scholars called BS and

133
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,919
some still do

134
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,960
but the idea stuck around popping up

135
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,960
again and again over the years fast

136
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,520
forward to Modern Times And this

137
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,680
theories got new life thanks to the

138
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,919
internet and some popular

139
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,400
documentaries the BBC's Jesus in India

140
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,759
from 2008 brought the idea to a whole

141
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,319
new audience it's like the theory got a

142
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:58,000
Netflix reboot and people are binging

143
00:05:53,319 --> 00:06:00,160
it Chapter 3 The Legend of St

144
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,759
Issa let's talk about the Legend of St

145
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,720
Issa it's like the ancient world's

146
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,199
version of a viral story spreading

147
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,639
across continents and captivating

148
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,280
imaginations for centuries so who's this

149
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,680
Issa character well according to some

150
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,319
Eastern Traditions Issa is another name

151
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,880
for Jesus but this isn't the Jesus you

152
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:19,599
might be familiar with from Sunday

153
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,759
school this is Jesus The Traveler the

154
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:27,039
Seeker the student of Eastern wisdom The

155
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:30,000
Story Goes that Issa AK Jesus spent his

156
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,319
lost years wandering through India and

157
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,400
Tibet soaking up knowledge like a

158
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,639
spiritual sponge he supposedly studied

159
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,280
with Buddhists Hindus and other Eastern

160
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,720
sages learning their ways and

161
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,639
teachings now here's where it gets

162
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,759
really interesting there are actually

163
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,919
some ancient texts that mention this Isa

164
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:52,120
figure one of the most famous is the

165
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:54,800
bavishya pirana an ancient Hindu text it

166
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:58,280
talks about a prophet named isami sounds

167
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,120
a lot like Jesus Messiah doesn't it who

168
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,680
came from the West

169
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,440
but wait there's more some folks point

170
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,240
to Tibetan manuscripts that allegedly

171
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,680
tell the tale of isa's travels and

172
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,759
studies these texts describe Isa

173
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,960
learning from Buddhist monks debating

174
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,000
with Hindu priests and even challenging

175
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,400
the cast system it's like Jesus was on

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,120
some kind of spiritual backpacking trip

177
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,280
collecting wisdom instead of

178
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,560
souvenirs another intriguing piece of

179
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,039
evidence comes from the Natan namavali a

180
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,080
collection of Hindu texts these texts

181
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:32,840
refer to a figure named Issa who

182
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,560
traveled and lived in India according to

183
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,960
the nathali Issa studied with Hindu and

184
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,720
Buddhist sages adopting their teachings

185
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,160
and

186
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,280
philosophies the Nathan mavali describes

187
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,159
Issa as a wise and enlightened figure

188
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,599
who sought spiritual knowledge in the

189
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:48,960
East this aligns with the idea that

190
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,919
Jesus could have traveled to India

191
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,840
during his Lost Years absorbing the rich

192
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,319
spiritual traditions of the

193
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,560
region these references in the naam of

194
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,159
vol add another layer of credibility to

195
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,560
the theory

196
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:03,360
they suggest that there were indeed

197
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,000
ancient accounts of a figure resembling

198
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,800
Jesus spending time in India learning

199
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,479
from the great spiritual masters of the

200
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,400
time adding another fascinating layer to

201
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:16,400
this story is the tradition of the

202
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Apostle Thomas visiting India modern

203
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,120
Syrian Christians of Kerala who

204
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,000
represent a significant Christian

205
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,800
population in India believe that Thomas

206
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,560
the disciple who famously questioned

207
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,000
Jesus's resurrection traveled to India

208
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,240
in ad 52 and baptized their

209
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,440
forefathers this tradition is supported

210
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,360
by various historical and religious

211
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,760
accounts the belief that Thomas

212
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,760
established Christian communities in

213
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,680
Kerala suggest early and direct

214
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,040
interactions between Christianity and

215
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,000
India this connection further supports

216
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,959
the plausibility of Jesus or his early

217
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,200
followers having knowledge of Indian

218
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,640
spiritual

219
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,880
Traditions these texts along with the

220
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,120
bisha piran Tibetan manuscripts and the

221
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,680
traditions of apostle Thomas build a

222
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,560
compelling narrative they weave together

223
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,440
a story of a young Jesus traveling far

224
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,720
from home seeking wisdom in the East and

225
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,680
returning with teachings that would

226
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,320
later resonate deeply with both eastern

227
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,320
and western

228
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,720
philosophies before we dive into the

229
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,880
theories let me share a quick personal

230
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,279
story when I first heard about the

231
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,600
possibility of Jesus traveling to India

232
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:25,880
I was skeptical too but then I

233
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,120
remembered a time when I took a

234
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,240
spontaneous trip seeking something I

235
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,079
couldn't quite Define

236
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,839
that Journey opened my mind to New

237
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:38,519
Perspectives and philosophies I never

238
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,600
considered before it made me think if a

239
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,000
regular guy like me could have such a

240
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,480
transformative

241
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,480
experience why not

242
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:53,560
Jesus it's chapter 5 the Kashmir

243
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,000
connection all right folks we're about

244
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,920
to get into one of the wildest parts of

245
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,760
this Theory the cashmir connection it's

246
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,160
like the season finale cliff of the

247
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,360
Jesus in India Saga so picture this

248
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,480
Jesus doesn't survive the crucifixion

249
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,640
plot twist and decides to retire in

250
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,920
Kashmir yeah you heard that right

251
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,000
Kashmir that beautiful mountainous

252
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,480
region between India and

253
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,040
Pakistan at the heart of this theory is

254
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,959
a shrine in Sagar kashmir's largest city

255
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,360
it's called the rosabal or the Tomb of

256
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,320
Jesus local tradition says It's the

257
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,399
final resting place of a prophet named

258
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,480
yuz Asaf now some people believe yuz

259
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,959
Asaf was another name for Jesus the tomb

260
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,519
itself is pretty unassuming a simple

261
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:42,560
building with a grave inside but it's

262
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:45,480
become a major attraction for Spiritual

263
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,040
tourists and curiosity Seekers It's like

264
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,920
the D Vinci Code but with more mountain

265
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,480
views and fewer European art museums now

266
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,040
you might be wondering what's the

267
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,480
evidence for this well supporters of the

268
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,839
theory point to a few things they talk

269
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,399
about local legends that have been

270
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,800
passed down for Generations they mention

271
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:06,639
ancient texts that supposedly reference

272
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,839
Jesus life in cashmir some even claim

273
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,639
there are similarities between Kashmir

274
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,680
and ancient Israeli Customs one of the

275
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:15,760
most intriguing bits of evidence is a

276
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,240
pair of carved Footprints near the

277
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,760
tomb Believers say these Footprints show

278
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,240
marks of crucifixion wounds it's like a

279
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,200
spiritual version of those Hollywood

280
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,200
handprints but way older and way more

281
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,200
controversial

282
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,200
chapter 6 from Scrolls to

283
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,120
screens let's dive into how this theory

284
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,240
has captured imaginations in books and

285
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,680
on screens it's like a historical

286
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,760
mystery that's gone viral across

287
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,000
different

288
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,760
media first let's talk documentaries the

289
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,120
BBC's Jesus in India from 2008 was a

290
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,120
game changer they sent a crew trekking

291
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,639
through India and Tibet exploring

292
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,160
ancient monasteries and texts it was

293
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,160
like Indiana Jones meets religious

294
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,839
studies minus the boulder chases then

295
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,880
we've got the history channels the Lost

296
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:07,079
Years of Jesus from

Series this one dug into various

299
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,000
theories about Jesus's Missing Years

300
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,120
with the India connection taking Center

301
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,519
Stage Discovery Channel jumped on the

302
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,800
bandwagon with Jesus in Kashmir the Lost

303
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,000
Tomb in

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,720
2007 this one zeroed in on that

305
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
mysterious tomb in serenar we talked

306
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,920
about earlier think CSI ancient Kashmir

307
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,639
with researchers playing historical

308
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,839
detectives now why did these

309
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:38,040
documentaries blow up well they took

310
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,600
this Fringe Theory out of Dusty academic

311
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,959
circles and beamed it into living rooms

312
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,639
worldwide suddenly dinner table

313
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,600
conversations were less about what's for

314
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,160
dessert and more about whether Jesus

315
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,880
went on a gap year to India but the

316
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,680
small screen isn't the only place this

317
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,920
Theory's been Making

318
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,279
Waves let's hit the books shall we it

319
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,480
all kicked off with Nicholas novices the

320
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,680
known life of Jesus Christ back in

322
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,440
world of religious studies novich

323
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,279
claimed he'd found ancient Tibetan

324
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,440
Scrolls telling the tale of Jesus or Isa

325
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:16,880
in

326
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,320
India talk about a plot twist but here's

327
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,839
the kicker no one's ever found these

328
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:26,199
Scrolls again convenient

329
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:28,720
right fast forward to 1908 and we've got

1981 this book became the modern Bible

339
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,880
pun intended for the Jesus in India

340
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,600
Theory compiling various evidence and

for anyone wanting to dive deep into

343
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,959
this idea and let's not forget Elizabeth

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,440
about jesus' life between ages 12 and 30

348
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,519
reading like a historical detective

349
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,880
novel piecing together Clues from across

350
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,759
cultures these books and documentaries

351
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,920
aren't just Gathering dust on shelves or

352
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,600
in streaming cues they've sparked

353
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,079
debates inspired further research

354
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,680
and got people looking at familiar

355
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,320
stories in completely new ways they've

356
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,720
created a whole subgenre of spiritual

357
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,279
historical speculation but here's the

358
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,759
million dooll question are these sources

359
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:45,079
legit well that's where things get

360
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:46,920
tricky mainstream Scholars often

361
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:49,759
criticize these works for lack of solid

362
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,519
evidence they point out inconsistencies

363
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,959
question the authenticity of sources and

364
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,079
raise eyebrows at some of the more

365
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,759
dramatic

366
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:59,240
claims but here's the thing whether

367
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,199
these books and documentaries are are

368
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,680
historically accurate or not they've had

369
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,399
a real impact they've got people

370
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,160
thinking about religious history in new

371
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,519
ways challenging assumptions and opening

372
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,480
Minds to new

373
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,759
possibilities it's a reminder of the

374
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,920
power of media and literature they can

375
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:19,560
shape how we see the world challenge our

376
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,920
beliefs and Inspire us to explore beyond

377
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,279
our usual boundaries so while we might

378
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,959
not want to take these sources as gospel

379
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:28,519
pun intended again they're definitely

380
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,000
worth a look if you're curious about

381
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:32,800
this Theory

382
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,399
who knows maybe diving into one of these

383
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,959
books or watching one of these

384
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,720
documentaries will spark your own

385
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:41,120
journey of Discovery just remember to

386
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,519
pack your critical thinking skills along

387
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,519
with your

388
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:51,480
Curiosity on chapter 7 teachings across

389
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,040
borders now let's get to the juicy part

390
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,279
comparing Jesus's teachings with

391
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,440
Buddhist ideas it's like we're setting

392
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,680
up a philosophical boxing match but

393
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
instead of throwing punches they're

394
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,759
throwing

395
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,959
wisdom first up we've got the golden

396
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:09,160
rule Jesus said do to others what you

397
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:11,720
would have them do to you Buddha's take

398
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,079
consider others as

399
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,199
yourself it's like their Cosmic twins

400
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,720
separated at Birth preaching the same

401
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:21,040
message of treating others right then

402
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,440
there's the whole deal with materialism

403
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,319
Jesus was all about it is easier for a

404
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,959
camel to go through the eye of a needle

405
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:30,240
than for someone who is Rich to enter

406
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,920
the kingdom of God meanwhile Buddha's

407
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,560
over here saying the root of suffering

408
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,079
is attachment both of them are basically

409
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,319
telling us to cool it with the shopping

410
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:43,160
spree and focus on what really matters

411
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:46,440
let's talk about inner peace Jesus drops

412
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,519
this gem the kingdom of God is within

413
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,399
you Buddha's not far off with peace

414
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,560
comes from within do not seek it without

415
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,279
it's like they both saying hey stop

416
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,600
looking for happiness in your Instagram

417
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:02,199
likes and start looking inside yourself

418
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,839
now on to forgiveness Jesus is famous

419
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:08,240
for saying turn the other cheek Buddha's

420
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:10,959
spin hatred does not cease by hatred but

421
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,000
only by love they're both pushing this

422
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,240
radical idea of breaking the cycle of

423
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,919
Revenge with some good oldfashioned

424
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,559
forgiveness but wait there's more some

425
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,000
Scholars argue that these similarities

426
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:23,199
aren't just coincidences they suggest

427
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,760
that Jesus might have directly

428
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,160
encountered these Buddhist teachings

429
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,799
during his Lost Years integrating them

430
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,520
into his own philosophy

431
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:34,080
consider the concept of compassion both

432
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,600
Jesus and Buddha emphasize the

433
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,000
importance of compassion towards others

434
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,200
Jesus's parable of the Good Samaritan

435
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,080
teaches us to help others regardless of

436
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,400
their background while Buddha's

437
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,640
teachings encourage boundless compassion

438
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,840
for all

439
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,799
beings the practice of mindfulness and

440
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,120
meditation is another intriguing

441
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,240
parallel while not explicitly mentioned

442
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,159
in the New Testament the idea of quiet

443
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,640
reflection and prayer is Central to

444
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,240
Jesus teachings simp similarly

445
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,679
meditation is a core practice in

446
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,080
Buddhism promoting inner peace and

447
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,000
Enlightenment moreover the notion of

448
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,960
selflessness and service to others is

449
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,240
deeply embedded in both

450
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,880
Traditions Jesus washed the feet of his

451
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,919
disciples teaching humility and service

452
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,320
Buddha's teachings also emphasize the

453
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,480
importance of serving others and living

454
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,120
a life free from selfish

455
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,559
desires these striking similarities

456
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,120
suggest a potential exchange of

457
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:32,280
ideas could Jesus have been inspired by

458
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,679
Buddhist teachings during his

459
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,960
travels the parallels in their messages

460
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,480
certainly give weight to this

461
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,480
fascinating

462
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,200
Theory chapter 8 the Skeptics corner all

463
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,880
right let's pump the brakes for a second

464
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,600
and look at the other side of the coin

465
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,120
it's time to put on our skeptic hats and

466
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,880
see what the scholars have to say about

467
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,000
this whole Jesus in India Theory first

468
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,760
off mainstream historians and biblical

469
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,720
Scholars aren't exactly jumping on this

470
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,880
bandwagon they're more likely to give it

471
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,320
the side eye than a thumbs up why well

472
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,360
they point out that there's a glaring

473
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,840
lack of solid historical evidence it's

474
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,919
like trying to prove you had a pet

475
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,600
dinosaur as a kid without any photos

476
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,880
bones or really big

477
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,760
Footprints many experts argue that if

478
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,760
Jesus had made such an epic journey to

479
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,120
India surely someone would have written

480
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,360
about it at the

481
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,280
time we're talking about a pretty big

482
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,280
deal here not exactly something you'd

483
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,480
forget to

484
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,240
mention yet the Gospels and other early

485
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,799
Christian writings are silent on this

486
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,799
supposed Asian

487
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,120
Adventure then there's the issue of

488
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,440
timing some Scholars say the timeline

489
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,480
doesn't add up they argue that Jesus

490
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,919
likely spent his youth in Nazareth

491
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,360
learning the Family Trade of carpentry

492
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,720
it's not like he could hop on a plane

493
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,360
for a quick trip to India we're talking

494
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,799
about a long dangerous Journey that

495
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,919
would have taken

496
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,080
years let's not forget about language if

497
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,320
Jesus had studied in India wouldn't he

498
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,400
have picked up some Sanskrit or poly yet

499
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,080
the gospels show him speaking Aramaic

500
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,679
and possibly some Greek or Hebrew no

501
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,679
sign of him dropping any Buddhist lingo

502
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:11,280
now about those similarities between

503
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,080
Christian and Buddhist teachings many

504
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,679
scholars say these can be explained

505
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,320
without Jesus taking a trip to India

506
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,799
they point out that some of these ideas

507
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,520
were already floating around the

508
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,919
Mediterranean world at the time it's

509
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,919
like how you and your friend on the

510
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,760
other side of the country might both be

511
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:30,640
into the same Tick Tock Trend ideas can

512
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,640
spread without Direct

513
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,320
contact all right folks we've been on

514
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,400
quite the journey today haven't we we've

515
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,799
explored ancient texts peaked into

516
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,120
Tibetan monasteries and even checked out

517
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:47,360
a tomb in Kashmir all to chase down this

518
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,159
wild idea that Jesus might have been

519
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,840
channeling his inner Buddha during those

520
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:56,320
mysterious Lost Years so what do we make

521
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,799
of all this well here's the

522
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,600
deal we can't say for sure if Jesus has

523
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,760
ever set foot in India or studied

524
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:07,000
Buddhism the evidence isn't there to

525
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:10,240
make that claim but you know what that's

526
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,279
okay because sometimes the value is in

527
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,919
the questions we ask not the answers we

528
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:18,159
find this whole Theory whether you buy

529
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,520
it or not gets us

530
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,320
thinking it makes us look at familiar

531
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:26,120
stories from new angles it reminds us

532
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,720
that history is complex full of

533
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,080
mysteries and possibilities we might

534
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,480
never fully un

535
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,159
rvel and isn't that kind of awesome it

536
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,880
also shows us how ideas can cross

537
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,360
borders and cultures in surprising ways

538
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,679
whether it's through ancient trade routs

539
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,200
or modern-day YouTube videos human

540
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,840
beings have always been sharing and

541
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,440
adapting each other's thoughts and

542
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,240
beliefs it's like we're all part of this

543
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,200
giant centuries long group chat of

544
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,520
ideas now I'm not here to tell you what

545
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,880
to believe that's your

546
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,159
call but I do hope this little

547
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,760
Expedition into the land of Whata if

548
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,320
has got your mental gears turning maybe

549
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,760
it's made you curious to learn more

550
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,720
about different religious Traditions or

551
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,559
perhaps it's inspired you to dig deeper

552
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,480
into history's Unsolved Mysteries so

553
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,640
here's my challenge to you keep

554
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,360
exploring keep questioning whether it's

555
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,799
this Theory or any other aspect of

556
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,880
history or religion that piques your

557
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:24,799
interest don't be afraid to dive in read

558
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,400
books watch documentaries talk to people

559
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,120
with different perspectives be curious

560
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,960
but also be critical look for evidence

561
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,520
