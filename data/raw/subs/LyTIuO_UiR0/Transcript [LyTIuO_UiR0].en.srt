4
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,119
ever wondered what happens after we die

5
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,280
in Buddhism the concept of hell is

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,120
anything but ordinary imagine waking up

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,800
one morning and realizing that your

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,160
entire life has been a series of

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,920
missteps and poor choices you're

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,800
suddenly faced with the unsettling

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,559
thought that your actions might have

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,559
some serious consequences in the

13
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,280
afterlife enter the concept of Buddhist

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,280
hell

15
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,559
a topic that's sure to raise some

16
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:06,240
eyebrows and get those mental gears

17
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,840
turning now I know the word hell can be

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,439
a bit of a buzzkill but trust me when I

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,560
say that the Buddhist version is far

20
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,439
from your typical fire and brimstone

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,759
nightmare in fact it's a fascinating and

22
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,439
complex concept that ties into the very

23
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,000
core of Buddhist teachings about Karma

24
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:25,360
rebirth and the nature of

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,799

Buddhist hell to really understand this

46
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,879
concept we need to touch on a couple of

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,519
fundamental Buddhist principles first up

48
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:26,560
we have Karma the idea that our actions

49
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,239
have consequences that can Ripple out

50
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,760
across

51
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,360
lifetimes if you missed previous video

link below to catch up trust me it's a

54
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,959
game changer next we have the concept of

55
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,519
rebirth or samsara this is the belief

56
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,080
that we're not just one and done when it

57
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,840
comes to living instead we're caught in

58
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,920
an ongoing cycle of birth death and

59
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,440
rebirth with our Karma influencing the

60
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,519
nature of each new

61
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,159
existence again if you need a refresher

62
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,319
check out Peter's awesome video on

63
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:01,959
samsara it's like a crash course in

64
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:04,400
Buddhist Phil philosophy think of karma

65
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,239
as a cosmic scorecard and samsara as an

66
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,239
endless game of

67
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,239
rebirths now here's where it gets juicy

68
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,360
according to Buddhist teachings there

69
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,560
are six main Realms into which we can be

70
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,159
reborn picture a cosmic game of roulette

71
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,000
except instead of landing on red or

72
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:24,319
black you could end up as a Heavenly

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,400
being a human an animal a Hungry Ghost

74
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,680
and aura or Titan or you guessed it in

75
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,319
one of the hell realms

76
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,920
now before you start having nightmares

77
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,799
about eternal damnation let me clarify

78
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,280
something

79
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,319
important the Buddhist hell Realms are

80
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,200
not like the fiery infernos you might

81
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,439
have heard about in other religious

82
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,519
traditions in Buddhism hell is more like

83
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,120
a temporary timeout a place where you

84
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,040
experience the consequences of your

85
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,040
negative actions until your karma runs

86
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,599
its course so yes the hell Realms are

87
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,720
definitely not a vacation destination

88
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,200
but the good news is that in Budd ISM

89
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,360
nothing lasts forever not even the most

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,760
intense

91
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,720
suffering with the right actions

92
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,360
intentions and mindset it's always

93
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,079
possible to break free from the cycle of

94
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,079
rebirth and set your sights on a better

95
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,199
future okay so now that we've covered

96
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,680
the basics let's get into the

97
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,360
nitty-gritty of Buddhist hell in

98
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,600
Buddhism the hell Realms are

99
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,360
collectively known as nraa and they're

100
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,320
not just one size fits all there are

101
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,160
multiple multiple hell Realms each with

102
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,160
its own unique brand of suffering now

103
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,600
before we dive into the specifics it's

104
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,360
important to note that the descriptions

105
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,600
of the hell Realms can vary depending on

106
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,440
the Buddhist text in the Mahayana

107
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,759
mahaparinirvana Sutra for example the

108
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,000
hell Realms are depicted somewhat

109
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,880
differently compared to the Dharma

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,240
analysis treasury but regardless of the

111
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,039
specific details these Realms are all

112
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,800
situated right here on our very own

113
00:04:54,039 --> 00:05:00,199
Kavala or World system according to

114
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,199
Buddhist cosmology

115
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,800
picture a cosmic layer cake with each

116
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,039
realm stacked on top of the other and

117
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,240
the hell Realms are right there at the

118
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,639
bottom let's start with the cold Hells

haven't even gotten to the hot Hells yet

147
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,000
like the cold Hells there are eight

148
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:34,199
major hot Hells each with its own unique

rava six tapana the heating hell where

165
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:22,840

deepest and most intense of all the hot

171
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:41,319
Hells now I know what you might be

172
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,919
thinking geez Matt this all sounds

173
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,759
pretty grim and you're not wrong the

174
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,159
naraka Realms are definitely not a walk

175
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,319
in the park but here's the thing in

176
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:53,599
Buddhism these hell Realms are not meant

177
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,080
to be taken literally they're powerful

178
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,680
metaphors for the suffering we can

179
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,280
experience in our own minds when we're

180
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,919
trapped in negative patterns of thought

181
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,440
and behavior when we're consumed by

182
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:05,960
anger hatred or greed it's like we're in

183
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,360
our own personal hell realm we're

184
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,199
tormented by our own negative emotions

185
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,960
unable to find peace or happiness and

186
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,240
just like in the nraa Realms it can feel

187
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,919
like there's no Escape but that's where

188
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,840
Buddhist practice comes in by

189
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:24,639
cultivating mindfulness compassion and

190
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,400
wisdom we can begin to break free from

191
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,039
our own mental hell Realms we can learn

192
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,360
to observe our thoughts and emotions

193
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,399
without getting caught up in them and we

194
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,800
can make choices that align with our

195
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:39,560
values and lead to Greater happiness and

196
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,039
peace so while the descriptions of the

197
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,320
nraa Realms might seem Intense or even

198
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,080
frightening they ultimately serve as a

199
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,000
powerful reminder of the importance of

200
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,839
our own thoughts actions and mind states

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,640
by taking responsibility for our own

202
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,440
minds and cultivating positive qualities

203
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:01,440
we can begin to free ourselves from

204
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,440
suffering both in this life and Beyond

205
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,720
so what's the point of all this why does

206
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,160
Buddhism emphasize these vivid

207
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,800
descriptions of

208
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,680
suffering first and foremost the hell

209
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,000
Realms remind us of the consequences of

210
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:20,399
our actions in Buddhism our thoughts

211
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,360
words and deeds impact not just

212
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,120
ourselves but also those around us and

213
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,560
the world as a whole negative actions

214
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,920
create the causes for future suffering

215
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,320
the hell Realms are not a punishment

216
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,320
handed down by some external Authority

217
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,399
but the natural result of our choices

218
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,519
and

219
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,079
behaviors just as a plant will bear

220
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,480
fruit according to the type of seed

221
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:43,519
planted our actions bear fruit according

222
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,959
to their nature these Realms also serve

223
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,120
as a powerful motivation for Spiritual

224
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:50,399
practice and personal

225
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,320
growth contemplating the suffering of

226
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,360
the hell Realms can develop a sense of

227
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,920
urgency and determination to break free

228
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,160
from negative thoughts and actions this

229
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,680
is where the Buddhist path of

230
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,440
mindfulness comp passion and wisdom

231
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,920
comes in by cultivating these positive

232
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,720
qualities we can begin to transform our

233
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,839
own minds and hearts Breaking Free from

234
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,720
the mental hell Realms that cause us so

235
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:14,839
much pain and

236
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,079
distress we can learn to respond to

237
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,079
challenges with greater equinity to

238
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:20,959
treat others with kindness and

239
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,360
understanding and to make choices that

240
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,920
lead to Greater peace and

241
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,120
happiness ultimately the purpose of the

242
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,279
hell Realms in Buddhism is not to scare

243
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,480
us or to condemn us but to wake us up to

244
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,480
shake us out of our complacency and

245
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,560
Inspire us to take responsibility for

246
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,959
our own minds and

247
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,160
actions by confronting the reality of

248
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,959
suffering headon we can develop the

249
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,680
compassion wisdom and skillful means

250
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,800
needed to transform that suffering and

251
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,800
to help others do the

252
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:57,200
same but how do we actually break free

253
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,440
from this cycle of suffering how do we

254
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,519
escape the endless round of rebirth and

255
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,720
find lasting peace and

256
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,079
happiness now for our regular viewers

257
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,920
this next part might be a bit of a

258
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:09,560
refresher but it's always good to

259
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,839
revisit the foundations of our practice

260
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,240
right as we've discussed many times

261
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,760
before the key to Breaking Free from the

262
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,320
cycle of suffering lies in the three

263
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,200
essential practices at the heart of the

264
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,360
Buddhist path mindfulness compassion and

265
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,639
wisdom these practices are like the

266
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,600
secret sauce of spiritual growth the

267
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:32,040
ingredients that when combined and

268
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,680
cultivated over time can lead us to the

269
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,079
ultimate goal of Enlightenment and what

270
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,720
is Enlightenment it's the complete

271
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:42,760
Liberation from suffering and the cycle

272
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,720
of rebirth a state of perfect wisdom

273
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,480
compassion and peace beyond all the ups

274
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,320
and downs of worldly

275
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,120
existence but as we all know this path

276
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,720
is not a quick fix or a Magic Bullet it

277
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,839
requires dedication effort and a

278
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,680
willingness to confront our own thoughts

279
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,040
emotions and behaviors with honesty and

280
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,839
compassion by cultivating mindfulness we

281
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,920
learn to observe our own experiences

282
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,839
with greater Clarity and

283
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,399
objectivity by cultivating compassion we

284
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,320
learn to connect with the suffering of

285
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,160
others and to respond with kindness and

286
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,000
skillful action and by cultivating

287
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,000
wisdom we learn to see through the

288
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,720
illusions of the self and the world to

289
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,880
understand the true nature of reality

290
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,040
beyond all Concepts and

291
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,800
categories I know many of you have heard

292
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,360
this before but it Bears repeating these

293
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,959
practices are not just abstract ideas or

294
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,959
lofty ideals they're practical tools

295
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,399
that we can apply in our daily lives

296
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,519
Moment by moment and the more we

297
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:44,279
cultivate them the more we begin to

298
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,160
experience their transformative power

299
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,279
the way they can help us break free from

300
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,959
old patterns of suffering and find

301
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:52,440
greater peace happiness and connection

302
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,800
in our

303
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,760
lives regardless of your background or

304
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,320
level of experience with Buddhism

305
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,920
remember the key to escaping the cycle

306
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,720
of suffering lies in the cultivation of

307
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,800
mindfulness compassion and wisdom it's a

308
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,880
journey that requires patience

309
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,680
perseverance and an open heart but it's

310
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,760
a journey that can lead to the greatest

311
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,760
happiness and freedom

312
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,480
imaginable how do these beliefs about

313
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,040
hell Realms in the cycle of rebirth

314
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,880
translate into real world Buddhist

315
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:31,240
practices one fascinating example is the

316
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,800
ghost Festival a traditional Buddhist

317
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,800
holiday observed in many Asian countries

318
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,399
particularly in China and

319
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,480
Vietnam during the Ghost Festival also

320
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,120
known as The Hungry Ghost Festival or

321
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,680
Ulen pen Festival it's believed that the

322
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,480
gates of hell are opened and the spirits

323
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,320
of the deceased are allowed to visit the

324
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,800
Living

325
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,240
World this includes not only ancestors

326
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,680
but also ghosts and spirits who have no

327
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,759
living descendants to venerate

328
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,600
them Buddhist practitioners and

329
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:03,120
community ities engage in various

330
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,040
rituals and offerings during this time

331
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,199
such as preparing food and drink for the

332
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,320
spirits burning JS paper a type of

333
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:13,480
ceremonial paper money and chanting

334
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,920
scriptures these practices are believed

335
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,639
to help alleviate the suffering of

336
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,800
beings in the hell Realms and to

337
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,440
generate Merit for both the living and

338
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,759
the deceased the Ghost Festival serves

339
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,040
as a powerful reminder of the

340
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:28,000
interconnectedness of all beings both

341
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,079
living and dead and the importance of

342
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,759
compassion and gener oity in the face of

343
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:36,160
suffering it's a time for Buddhists to

344
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:38,320
reflect on the impermanence of Life the

345
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,040
consequences of our actions and the

346
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,560
potential for spiritual growth and

347
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,800
Liberation so the next time you hear

348
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,279
about the Ghost Festival or similar

349
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,279
practices in Buddhist communities keep

350
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:52,959
in mind the deeper significance Behind

351
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:55,320
These rituals they're not just colorful

352
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,480
cultural Traditions they're a reflection

353
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,519
of the profound teachings on suffering

354
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,440
rebirth and the path to Enlightenment

355
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,440
that lie at the heart of

356
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,360
Buddhism as we explore these Concepts

357
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,880
it's crucial to approach them with

358
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,440
cultural sensitivity and an awareness of

359
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:16,279
potential pitfalls such as

360
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,560
orientalism orientalism as coined by

361
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:20,720
scholar Edward SED refers to the

362
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,759
tendency of Western cultures to view and

363
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,959
represent Eastern cultures in a

364
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:26,320
stereotypical exoticized or

365
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,480
essentialized

366
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,519
manner when it comes to Buddhist hell

367
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,079
realms there's a risk of falling into

368
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,199
orientalist traps such as focusing on

369
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:37,199
the most Sensational or gruesome aspects

370
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,199
of these teachings without proper

371
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,120
context or understanding it's important

372
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:44,279
to remember that Buddhist teachings on

373
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,240
Hell Realms are part of a complex

374
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,480
nuanced religious and philosophical

375
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,199
tradition they're not meant to be taken

376
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,759
literally or in isolation but rather as

377
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,959
part of a larger framework for

378
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,319
understanding suffering Karma and the

379
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,319
path to

380
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:00,040
Enlightenment as we explore these

381
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:02,839
Concepts let's strive to approach them

382
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,680
with respect curiosity and a willingness

383
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:05,959
to learn from the lived experiences and

384
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,240
interpretations of Buddhist

385
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:10,880
practitioners

386
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,120
themselves by doing so we can avoid the

387
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,079
pitfalls of orientalism and gain a more

388
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,519
authentic nuanced understanding of these

389
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:18,360
teachings and their significance in

390
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,600
Buddhist thought and

391
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,680
practice if you encounter descriptions

392
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,440
of Buddhist hell Realms take a moment to

393
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,519
critically examine how these ideas are

394
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,920
being presented and framed are they

395
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,319
being sensationalized or taken out of

396
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,839
context are the voices and perspectives

397
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:36,880
of Buddhist practitioners being centered

398
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,600
by asking these questions we can work

399
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,480
towards a more balanced culturally

400
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,240
sensitive understanding of this complex

401
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,240
and fascinating aspect of Buddhist

402
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,680
cosmology imagine realizing that the

403
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,519
hell Realms are not external places but

404
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,360
internal States we create through our

405
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,839
own actions and thoughts this Revelation

406
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,160
is empowering it means that we have the

407
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,959
power to change our destiny not through

408
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,040
fear of punishment but through

409
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,280
cultivating positive qualities like

410
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,039
compassion mindfulness and

411
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,120
wisdom this moment of realization can be

412
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,360
life-changing it's the point where

413
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,240
understanding transforms into action and

414
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,520
we see that our spiritual journey is not

415
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,240
about avoiding hell but about creating

416
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,679
Heaven within ourselves through our

417
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,679
daily

418
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,799
practices all right folks we've covered

419
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:30,000
a lot of ground today from the fiery

420
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:32,559
pits of the hell realms to the lofty

421
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,960
Heights of Enlightenment we've explored

422
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,640
the nature of suffering the consequences

423
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,200
of our actions and the path to

424
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,720
Liberation but before we wrap things up

425
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,120
let's take a moment to reflect on some

426
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,760
of the key takeaways from our

427
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,760
discussion remember as the Mahayana

428
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,440
mahaparinirvana Sutra

429
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,160
teaches all conditioned phenomena are

430
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,080
like a dream an

431
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,400
Illusion by understanding the

432
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,840
metaphorical nature of Buddhist Hells we

433
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,440
can better navigate our mental state

434
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,559
States and cultivate a life of peace and

435
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,840
wisdom remember that the path to

436
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:08,280
Liberation is not a one-time event or a

437
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,120
quick fix it's a lifelong journey of

438
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,039
growth learning and

439
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,240
transformation by cultivating the

440
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,480
essential practices of mindfulness

441
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,120
compassion and wisdom we can gradually

442
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,120
break free from the cycle of suffering

443
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,000
and rebirth and experience a deeper

444
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:28,080
sense of Peace purpose and connection

445
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,520
with all things and finally remember

446
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,000
that you're not alone on this path as a

447
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,640
