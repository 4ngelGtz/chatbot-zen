life we find ourselves reborn again and

beyond the idea of simple

reincarnation revealing the intricate

40
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,320
web of cause and effect that binds us to

world let's unravel the mysteries of

Liberation now let's jump into the heart

49
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,319
of the matter what exactly is

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,280
samsara in the simplest terms samsara

51
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:34,640
refers to to The Continuous cycle of

52
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,440
birth death and rebirth that all beings

53
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,560
go through according to Buddhist

54
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,640
teachings it's the endless Journey

55
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,959
Through the various Realms of existence

56
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,879
driven by our Karma and our unresolved

57
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,519
desires and

58
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,400
attachments in Buddhism reincarnation

59
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,400
refers to the belief that after death a

60
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,959
person's Consciousness or soul is reborn

61
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,840
into a new

62
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,720
body this process is repeated over and

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,360
over again with each new life being

64
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,280
determined by the actions and intentions

65
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,560
Karma of the previous life this

66
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,680
continuous cycle of death and rebirth is

67
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,599
known as

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,920
samsara the suffering of rebirth is a

69
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,599
central theme in Buddhist

70
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,159
teachings each time a being is reborn

71
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:23,239
they are subject to the inherent

72
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,920
suffering of existence such as birth

73
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,319
aging sickness and

74
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,280
death even in the higher Realms where

75
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,879
beings experience immense pleasures and

76
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,879
long lifespans suffering is still

77
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,319
present in the form of impermanence and

78
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:41,720
the inevitability of change in the lower

79
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:45,319
Realms suffering is more apparent with

80
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:48,000
beings experiencing intense pain hunger

81
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:50,319
fear and other forms of

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,120
distress the Buddha taught that as long

83
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,120
as we remain trapped in

84
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,519
samsara we will continue to experience

85
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,720
suffering regardless of which realm we

86
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,159
are born

87
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,840
into samsara however is more than just

88
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,680
reincarnation it encompasses the entire

89
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:12,040
cycle of existence from birth to death

90
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:15,000
and all the joys sorrows and experiences

91
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,600
in between it's the endless Journey

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,120
Through the various Realms of existence

93
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,799
driven by our Karma and our unresolved

94
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,799
desires and

95
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,479
attachments imagine this you're a weary

96
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,440
traveler moving from One Life to the

97
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,680
next carrying the weight of of your past

98
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,360
actions and experiences with

99
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,440
you each New Birth is like a fresh start

100
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,320
but it's also influenced by the karma

101
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,240
you've accumulated in your previous

102
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,720
lives this cycle continues

103
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,560
indefinitely with beings rising and

104
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,919
falling through the different Realms

105
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,840
experiencing the full spectrum of Joys

106
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,919
and Sorrows that existence has to

107
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,759
offer in Buddhist cosmology there are

108
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,000
six main Realms that beings can be

109
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,199
reborn into within samsara these include

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,199
the God Realm the demigod realm the

111
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:13,320
human realm the animal realm the Hungry

112
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,280
Ghost realm and the hell

113
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,120
realm each of these Realms is

114
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,000
characterized by a specific type of

115
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,400
suffering or happiness and the actions

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,199
we take in our current life can

117
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,440
determine which realm we'll be reborn

118
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,960
into next but here's the thing no matter

119
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,000
which realm we find ourselves in the

120
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,639
experience of samsara ultimately Ely

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,960
leads to

122
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,759
discontentment even the gods who enjoy

123
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,800
immense pleasures and long

124
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,680
lifespans are not immune to the

125
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,400
inevitability of change and death they

126
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,400
too will eventually fall from their

127
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,759
lofty positions and be reborn in a lower

128
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,840
realm this is why the Buddha taught that

129
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,720
true happiness and Liberation cannot be

130
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,560
found within samsara itself so if

131
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,400
samsara is this endless cycle of

132
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,479
suffering what keeps us trapped within

133
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:04,880
it the answer lies in the very fabric of

134
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:07,880
our being our ignorance attachment and

135
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,319
aversion these are known as the three

136
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:15,840
poisons the three poisons are the root

137
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:17,000
causes that keep us bound to the cycle

138
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,919
of

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,800
samsara and understanding them is key to

140
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:26,319
Breaking Free from the wheel of rebirth

141
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,479
as the Buddha said the root of suffering

142
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,560
is

143
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,560
attachment dhapa vers

144
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,479
2011 first let's talk about ignorance

145
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,440
this isn't just a lack of knowledge or

146
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,479
information it's a fundamental

147
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,319
misunderstanding of the nature of

148
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:49,680
reality we cling to the idea of a

149
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,360
permanent unchanging self and we believe

150
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,280
that the things we desire will bring us

151
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,400
lasting happiness but the truth is that

152
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,639
everything in this world is impermanent

153
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,720
and subject to change by failing to

154
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,400
recognize this we set ourselves up for

155
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,400
suffering and

156
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,879
disappointment next we have attachment

157
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,919
this is the craving or desire that

158
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,840
arises when we encounter something we

159
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:18,680
find Pleasant or enjoyable whether it's

160
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,160
a material object a sensory experience

161
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,680
or even a person we grasp at it hoping

162
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,639
to make it a permanent part of our lives

163
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,840
but as we've seen nothing lasts

164
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,879
forever and when the object of our

165
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,160
attachment in inevitably changes or

166
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,720
disappears we're left with a sense of

167
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,720
loss and

168
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,560
dissatisfaction finally there's aversion

169
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:45,319
which is the flip side of attachment

170
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:48,120
this is the anger hatred or repulsion we

171
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:50,840
feel towards anything we deem unpleasant

172
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,159
or uncomfortable we try to push these

173
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,960
experiences away but in doing so we

174
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:58,800
create even more suffering for ourselves

175
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,400
we get caught up in cycles of negative

176
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,400
emotions and reactive Behavior which

177
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,199
only serve to reinforce our sense of

178
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,199
separation and

179
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,599
dissatisfaction together these three

180
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,800
poisons create a web of craving and

181
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,599
delusion that keeps us trapped in

182
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,199
samsara we chase after the things we

183
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:22,400
desire flee from the things we dislike

184
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:26,280
and remain ignorant of the true nature

185
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:29,520
of reality as a result we continue to

186
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:34,279
create Karma both positive and negative

187
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,279
negative which propels us into future

188
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,760
rebirths but here's the good news the

189
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,880
Buddha didn't just diagnose the problem

190
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,800
he also provided a solution by following

191
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,880
the path he laid out the Noble

192
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,040
eight-fold Path we can start the process

193
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,640
of freeing ourselves from the complex

194
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,279
network of samsara and move towards true

195
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,000
freedom and

196
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:01,399
happiness this path involves practicing

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,640
Right View view right intention right

198
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:08,680
speech right action right livelihood

199
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,880
right effort right mindfulness and right

200
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,880
concentration by cultivating these

201
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,640
qualities and insights we can start to

202
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,200
see through the illusion of the self and

203
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,360
the inherent dissatisfaction of

204
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,560
samsara we can learn to let go of our

205
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,200
attachments transform our aversions and

206
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,000
live with greater wisdom and compassion

207
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,519
and ultimately we can break free from

208
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,519
the cycle of rebirth all together

209
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,920
attaining the Supreme happiness and

210
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,959
peace of

211
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,880
Nirvana but the journey to Liberation is

212
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,760
not always an easy one it requires

213
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:46,090
dedication discipline and a willingness

214
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:50,160
to confront the deepest parts of

215
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:52,920
[Music]

216
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,959
ourselves samsara is driven by our own

217
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,920
ignorance attachment and aversion the

218
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:00,079
three poisons that keep us trapped in

219
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,399
the cycle of rebirth

220
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:05,160
but where do these poisons come from and

221
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:09,160
how do they create the karma that

222
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,160
propels us through the various Realms of

223
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,560
existence at the most fundamental level

224
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,519
the cause of samsara is our own mind

225
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,880
it's the way we perceive and interact

226
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,640
with the world around us based on our

227
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,200
past experiences our conditioning and

228
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,079
our innate

229
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,399
Tendencies when we're caught up in the

230
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:31,399
delusion of the self we naturally grasp

231
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,320
at the things we find Pleasant and push

232
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,600
away the things we find

233
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,399
unpleasant this creates a NeverEnding

234
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,560
cycle of craving and aversion as we try

235
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,000
to control and manipulate our experience

236
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,360
to suit our

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,399
desires but the problem is that this

238
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,079
approach never really works no matter

239
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,880
how much we chase after the things we

240
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,079
want or try to avoid the things we don't

241
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,040
we can never find lasting

242
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:57,399
satisfaction this is because everything

243
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,360
in the world is impermanent and subject

244
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,880
to change

245
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,200
the pleasure we derive from our

246
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,120
attachments is fleeting and the

247
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,360
discomfort we experience from our

248
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,240
aversions is inevitable so we find

249
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,000
ourselves caught in a bind we're

250
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,200
constantly trying to rearrange the

251
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,600
pieces of Our Lives to create a sense of

252
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,079
stability and happiness but the very

253
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,240
nature of samsara makes this

254
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:23,800
impossible it's like trying to build a

255
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,440
castle on a foundation of sand no matter

256
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,959
how carefully we construct it it's bound

257
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,440
to crumble and

258
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:36,360
fall and yet yet we keep

259
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:39,480
trying we keep chasing after the next

260
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,720
big thing the next experience that we

261
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,600
think will finally make us happy we keep

262
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,399
running from the things that scare us or

263
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,600
make us uncomfortable hoping that we can

264
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,480
somehow escape the realities of life and

265
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,519
in doing so we create more and more

266
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,800
karma both positive and negative that

267
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,440
keeps us spinning on the wheel of

268
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,399
samsara this is why the Buddha placed so

269
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,040
much emphasis on understanding the true

270
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:09,000
nature of the self and the world around

271
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,959
us by seeing things as they really are

272
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,639
free from the distortions of our own

273
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,519
minds we can begin to release ourselves

274
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:17,760
from the repetitive Loop of attachment

275
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,560
and repulsion we can start to let go of

276
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,600
our attachments and make peace with the

277
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,920
inevitable ups and downs of Life of

278
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,279
course this isn't easy it requires a

279
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,320
deep level of introspection and a

280
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,560
willingness to confront the parts of our

281
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,440
elves that we may have been avoiding for

282
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,639
a long time but with practice and

283
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,440
patience we can slowly start to untangle

284
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,360
the knots of our own making and find a

285
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,920
greater sense of freedom and

286
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,720
peace and as we do so we may start to

287
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,279
notice something

288
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,760
interesting we may start to see that the

289
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:55,360
very things we thought were causing our

290
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,320
suffering the external circumstances of

291
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,800
our lives are not really the problem at

292
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,000
all

293
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,680
the real cause of our suffering is the

294
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,920
way we relate to those

295
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,560
circumstances the way we grasp at what

296
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,760
we like and push away what we

297
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,399
don't this is a profound realization and

298
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,320
it's one that can change the way we live

299
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,079
our

300
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,519
lives instead of constantly trying to

301
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:22,560
control and manipulate the world around

302
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:25,800
us we can start to focus on changing our

303
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,120
own minds we can start to cultivate the

304
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,560
qualities of wisdom compassion and

305
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,480
equinity that will allow us to navigate

306
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,440
the ups and downs of life with greater

307
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,959
ease and Grace and as we do so we may

308
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,959
find that the causes of samsara start to

309
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:42,760
lose their grip on us we may find that

310
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,480
we're able to face the challenges of

311
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,880
life with a greater sense of resilience

312
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,639
and perspective knowing that everything

313
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,480
is impermanent and that our true nature

314
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,519
is something much deeper and more

315
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,759
profound than the fleeting experiences

316
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,880
of the

317
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,399
self let's remember that the causes of

318
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,680
our suffering are not outside of

319
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,600
ourselves

320
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,880
they're within us in the very fabric of

321
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,480
our own

322
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,279
minds and with practice patience and a

323
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,399
willingness to look deeply we can start

324
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:12,440
to unravel those causes and find a

325
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,320
greater sense of freedom and peace both

326
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,320
for ourselves and for all

327
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,160
beings it's now important to also

328
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,880
consider the consequences of this

329
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,360
endless cycle of

330
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,120
rebirth what happens when we remain

331
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,839
Bound by our our own ignorance

332
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,959
attachment and aversion and what are the

333
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:37,600
effects of this on our lives and the

334
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,240
lives of those around us perhaps the

335
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,680
most obvious consequence of being

336
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:45,240
trapped in samsara is the daily

337
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,279
struggles and unease that we Face even

338
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,720
in the moments when we feel happy and

339
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,880
content there's always an underlying

340
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,480
sense that something is missing that

341
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,120
we're not quite

342
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,519
whole we may distract ourselves with

343
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,160
various pleasures and Pursuits but deep

344
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,079
down we know know that these things can

345
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,759
never truly satisfy

346
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,440
us this is because the very nature of

347
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:10,519
samsara is one of impermanence and

348
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,360
change as the Buddha taught all

349
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:16,360
conditioned things are impermanent when

350
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:20,920
one sees this with wisdom One turns away

351
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:23,560
from suffering dapada verse

352
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,639
277 no matter how much we try to hold on

353
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,120
to the things we love or push away the

354
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,600
things we don't we can never escape the

355
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,720
fact that everything is constantly

356
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,040
shifting and evolving our relationships

357
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,519
our possessions our own bodies and Minds

358
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,120
all of these things are subject to the

359
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:41,440
forces of time and change and no amount

360
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,800
of grasping or aversion can alter this

361
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,519
fundamental truth and yet we keep trying

362
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,319
we keep clinging to the illusion of

363
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,319
permanence hoping that somehow this time

364
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:53,000
will be

365
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:56,120
different we build our lives around the

366
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,880
pursuit of stability and security only

367
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,639
to watch as everything we've worked for

368
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,639
crumbles away in the face of

369
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:06,600
impermanence this can be a deeply

370
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:09,720
painful and disillusioning process one

371
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:13,199
that leaves us feeling lost alone and

372
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,199
disconnected from the world around

373
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,160
us but the consequences of being trapped

374
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,319
in Sam Sara go beyond just our own

375
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,360
personal

376
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:27,519
suffering when we're caught up in the

377
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,399
cycle of craving and aversion we often

378
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,079
act in ways that cause harm harm to

379
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,319
ourselves and others we may lash out in

380
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,360
anger when things don't go our way or we

381
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:39,120
may withdraw into ourselves when we feel

382
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,120
hurt or afraid we may engage in

383
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,120
addictive or destructive behaviors

384
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,040
hoping to find some kind of escape from

385
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,160
the pain of our own existence and all of

386
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,279
this has Ripple effects that extend far

387
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:54,680
beyond our own lives our actions and

388
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:57,519
choices impact the people around us the

389
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,279
communities we live in and the world as

390
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,360
a whole

391
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,839
when we're trapped in samsara we're not

392
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,480
able to show up as our best selves to be

393
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,600
of service to others or to create the

394
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,720
kind of positive change that the world

395
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,600
so desperately needs but perhaps the

396
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,400
most tragic consequence of being trapped

397
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,360
in samsara is that it prevents us from

398
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,039
realizing our true nature and potential

399
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,079
the Buddha taught that all beings have

400
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,039
the capacity for awakening for

401
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,400
Liberation from the cycle of suffering

402
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,400
and rebirth but when we're caught up in

403
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,360
the delusions of the self

404
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,320
we're not able to see this potential

405
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,840
within ourselves or others we remain

406
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,400
stuck in a limited and distorted view of

407
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,919
reality unable to experience the

408
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,400
boundless freedom and joy that is our

409
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,799
Birthright and so we continue to wander

410
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,120
through the Realms of samsara pushed and

411
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,559
pulled by the forces of our own

412
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,160
ignorance and

413
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,480
craving we may experience moments of

414
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,960
happiness and pleasure but these are

415
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,159
always fleeting always giving way to the

416
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,520
next cycle of discontentment and

417
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:06,080
distress and all the while we remain

418
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,400
blind to the deeper reality of our own

419
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,000
being to the vast and luminous nature of

420
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,000
our own

421
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,600
minds but the good news is that we don't

422
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,880
have to remain trapped in this cycle

423
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,360
forever the Buddhist teachings offer us

424
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,520
a path to Liberation a way to break free

425
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,320
from the chains of samsara and realize

426
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,280
our true potential as awakened beings by

427
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,320
practicing mindfulness compassion and

428
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,280
wisdom

429
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,080
we can slowly start to untangle the

430
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,360
knots of our own suffering and find a

431
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,679
deeper sense of Peace and Freedom it's

432
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,440
not always an easy path and it requires

433
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,000
a great deal of dedication and effort

434
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,200
but the rewards are

435
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,159
immeasurable as we start to see through

436
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,320
the illusions of the self and the world

437
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,280
around us we begin to experience a

438
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,320
profound sense of connection and unity

439
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,840
with all

440
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,679
things we start to live from a place of

441
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Greater Love compassion and

442
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,840
understanding knowing that we are all

443
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:09,120
part of a vast and interconnected web of

444
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,159
being and as we do so the consequences

445
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,080
of being trapped in samsara start to

446
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:15,000
Fall

447
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,880
Away we no longer feel the need to grasp

448
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,480
at fleeting Pleasures or push away

449
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,600
inevitable

450
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,880
discomforts we are able to meet the

451
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,640
challenges of life with greater

452
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,200
resilience and Grace knowing that

453
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,960
everything is impermanent and that our

454
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,880
true nature nature is something much

455
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,120
deeper and more profound than the

456
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,960
fluctuations of the

457
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,240
self so remember the consequences of

458
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,600
being trapped in samsara but also

459
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,039
remember the boundless potential that

460
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:50,440
lies within each and every one of us

461
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:52,240
with practice patience and an open heart

462
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,640
we can all find our way to Greater

463
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,640
Freedom happiness and peace

464
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:03,039
[Music]

465
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,960
as we've seen the consequences of being

466
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,480
trapped in samsara are significant

467
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,559
leading to a sense of suffering

468
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,640
dissatisfaction and disconnection from

469
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,320
our true

470
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,360
nature but the Buddha's teachings also

471
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,039
offer us a way out a path to Liberation

472
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,240
that can free us from the endless cycle

473
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:25,120
of rebirth and help us to realize our

474
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:28,000
deepest potential for happiness and

475
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,240
peace this path is known as the noble

476
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,880
eight-fold PA path and it consists of

477
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,080
eight key components that work together

478
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,559
to transform our minds and our lives as

479
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,760
the Buddha taught the path to true

480
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,400
happiness and Liberation is the Noble

481
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,880
eight-fold Path right understanding

482
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:49,039
right thought right speech right action

483
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:52,000
right livelihood right effort right

484
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,640
mindfulness and right

485
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,159
concentration at its core the Noble

486
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,360
eight-fold Path is about developing

487
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:02,200
wisdom compassion

488
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,679
and mindfulness in all aspects of Our

489
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,640
Lives by cultivating these qualities we

490
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,679
can begin to see through the illusions

491
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,440
of the self and the world around us and

492
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,520
start to live in a way that is more

493
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,000
aligned with our true

494
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,240
nature one of the key aspects of the

495
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,520
path is Right View which involves

496
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,400
understanding the four noble truths and

497
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,120
the nature of some Sara this

498
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,679
understanding helps us to see the root

499
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,880
causes of our suffering and the way to

500
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,440
freedom and it provides a foundation for

501
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,039
the rest of the path from there we can

502
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,880
start to cultivate right intention which

503
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:40,640
involves setting our minds on the path

504
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:44,279
of Liberation and committing to a life

505
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,600
of compassion wisdom and

506
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,919
non-harming this intention guides our

507
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,559
actions and choices helping us to make

508
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,520
decisions that are in line with our

509
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:56,200
deepest values and

510
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,679
aspirations as we continue on the path

511
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,919
we also work to develop right speech

512
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:04,120
right action and right

513
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,720
livelihood this means speaking and

514
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:10,440
acting in ways that are honest kind and

515
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,919
beneficial to ourselves and others and

516
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,400
choosing a way of life that does not

517
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,279
cause harm or

518
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:19,919
suffering at the same time we cultivate

519
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:23,200
right effort right

520
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,960
mindfulness and right

521
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,360
concentration these practices help us to

522
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,840
develop greater awareness Focus I and

523
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,919
resilience in the face of life's

524
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,360
challenges allowing us to meet each

525
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,760
moment with greater Clarity and

526
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,159
compassion through this process of inner

527
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,240
transformation we slowly start to loosen

528
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:46,039
the grip of samsara on our minds and

529
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,240
hearts we begin to experience a deeper

530
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,600
sense of Peace contentment and

531
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,440
connection with the world around us even

532
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,919
in the midst of life's ups and downs

533
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,720
there will be times when we feel stuck

534
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:58,559
confused or overwhelmed and it can be

535
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,159
tempting to fall back into Old patterns

536
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,120
of grasping and aversion but with

537
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:05,480
practice and patience we can learn to

538
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,840
meet these challenges with greater

539
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:11,640
skillfulness and Grace we can learn to

540
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,640
see each moment as an opportunity for

541
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,320
growth and Awakening and to trust in the

542
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,919
inherent wisdom and compassion of our

543
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,720
own minds as we do so we may start to

544
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,039
notice profound shifts in the way we

545
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,600
experience ourselves and the world

546
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:30,240
around us we may find that our

547
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,400
relationships become more harmonious and

548
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,080
fulfilling that our work becomes a

549
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,840
source of joy and purpose and that our

550
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,000
lives as a whole feel more aligned with

551
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,760
our deepest values and

552
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,919
aspirations and perhaps most importantly

553
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,120
we may start to experience a sense of

554
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,279
Liberation from the suffering and

555
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,720
dissatisfaction of

556
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,600
samsara we may find that we're able to

557
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,799
meet life's challenges with greater

558
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,720
equinity and resilience knowing that our

559
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:59,159
true nature is something much deeper and

560
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,159
more profound

561
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:04,520
than the fluctuations of the self so

562
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,559
remember that Liberation is possible and

563
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,640
that each moment is an opportunity to

564
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:13,960
take a step closer to Freedom with

true nature as awakened

575
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,919
beings as we come to the end of our

576
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,159
exploration of samsara and the path to

577
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,880
Liberation I want to take a moment to

578
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,720

579
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,840

580
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,840

share these teachings with you and to

582
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,240
witness the profound transformations

583
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,520
that can happen when we open our hearts

584
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,000
and Minds to the wisdom of the

585
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,159
Buddha throughout our time together

586
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,360
we've explored the nature of samsara and

587
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,520
the causes that keep us trapped within

588
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:16,919
it we've seen how our own ignorance

589
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,960
attachment and aversion create a cycle

590
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,039
of suffering and dissatisfaction that

591
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,559
can feel endless and

592
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,679
inescapable but we've also discovered

593
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:27,679
that there is a way out a path to

594
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,399
Freedom that is available to us in every

595
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,440
moment by cultivating the qualities of

596

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,000
mindfulness we can start to break free

598
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:41,679
from the cycle of rebirth and realize

599
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,679
