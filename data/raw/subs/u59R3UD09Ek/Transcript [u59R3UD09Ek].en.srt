1
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:13,233
the Buddha lay dying between two sala trees

2
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:15,266
his body racked with dysentery

3
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:18,900
around him disciples wept openly

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,100
Ananda his faithful attendant

5
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:23,733
couldn't stop shaking

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,900
"Master" Ananda sobbed

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,800
"how can we live without you"

8
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:31,466
the Buddha's eyes open surprisingly gentle

9
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,466
don't grieve my friend

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,066
even this old body must return to dust

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,366
but what happened next changed everything

12
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:46,466
his students thought they knew about death

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,833
instead of simply fading away

14
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,766
the Buddha did something remarkable

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,433
texts describe him entering the first

16
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:55,966
meditative absorption

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,100
then the second the third

18
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,566
each deeper than the last

19
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:04,200
his breathing slowed

20
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:08,566
his face became serene

21
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:16,300
the disciples watched in amazement

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,000
as their teacher systematically

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,766
moved through deeper states of consciousness

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,800
finally

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,333
dissolving into something beyond ordinary experience

26
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,166
this wasn't just a great teacher dying

27
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:31,533
this was a demonstration

28
00:01:36,366 --> 00:01:37,900
came his final word

29
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:45,000
then according to later Mahāyāna tradition

30
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,866
something luminous occurred

31
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,700
as his consciousness departed

32
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:52,466
witnesses reported a brilliant radiance

33
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,000
not from outside but from within

34
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,566
as if awareness itself had become light

35
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:04,066
twenty five centuries later

36
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:05,466
we're still trying to understand

37
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:07,600
what the Buddha demonstrated that day

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,966
because I believe

39
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:11,533
he didn't just show us how to die consciously

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,633
he revealed something profound

41
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,166
about the nature of consciousness itself

42
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:19,600
I'm Peter and tonight

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,633
we begin the most important exploration

44
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:23,600
Buddha's wisdom has ever undertaken

45
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,233
but I need to be

46
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:28,066
honest about why this matters to me personally

47
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,533
and why it might transform how you see life and death

48
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:34,500
few years ago

49
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,300
I experienced what I can only call a death awakening

50
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,733
my father was dying in hospice

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,100
and I was completely unprepared

52
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,700
watching someone you love slip away

53
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,333
while you stand there helpless

54
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
it shattered something in me

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,666
that night I couldn't sleep

56
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,933
not just from grief but from a terrifying realization

57
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,800
I had no idea what had just happened to him

58
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,466
the thought of my own inevitable death

59
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:07,766
became this crushing weight I carried everywhere

60
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,266
so I did what any obsessive researcher does

61
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:14,500
I dove deep into every tradition's teachings on death

62
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,166
Christianity Islam

63
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Hinduism

64
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,633
but it was Buddhist

65
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,300
death teachings that stopped me in my tracks

66
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,066
not because they offered easy comfort

67
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:27,733
Buddhism doesn't do that

68
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:30,566
but because they offered something more valuable

69
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:34,700
detailed maps based on 2,500 years of people

70
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,800
actually studying

71
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,600
what happens when consciousness departs the body

72
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:42,800
tonight we begin a series of explorations

73
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,566
into death in Buddhism

74
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,333
if you've been following our journey together

75
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:47,966
you know

76
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:50,433
we've explored why Buddhists don't believe in god

77
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:53,666
and examined the emptiness that underlies all existence

78
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,600
tonight we step into Buddhism's most profound mystery

79
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,033
Buddhism teaches something that turns death upside down

80
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:08,333
death isn't termination but transformation

81
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,900
and different Buddhist traditions

82
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,033
have developed completely different navigation systems

83
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:15,800
for the same mysterious journey

84
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,766
but here's what changed my perspective

85
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:20,033
completely modern

86
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:22,833
science is starting to validate these ancient insights

87
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:26,166
in ways that even convinced this former skeptic

88
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,866
ready? together

89
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:34,000
we'll open the door to Buddhism's most profound mystery

90
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:43,466
let me start with a story that captures everything

91
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:45,033
you need to know about Buddhist

92
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:46,900
teachings on conscious dying

93
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,266
last year Sarah Chen was dying of pancreatic cancer

94
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:52,733
at a Buddhist hospice in San Francisco

95
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,066
she'd been terrified of death her entire life

96
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:57,700
but in her final moment

97
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,133
something remarkable happened

98
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,000
as her breathing stopped

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,200
she smiled and whispered to her daughter

100
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,100
"I can feel my body dissolving

101
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,266
but I'm still here

102
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:12,866
it's exactly like the teachings described"

103
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,466
her death wasn't an ending

104
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:16,633
it was a practice

105
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:19,666
this illustrates Buddhism's most radical teaching

106
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,033
death isn't an ending

107
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:23,766
but a process that can be navigated consciously

108
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:26,133
if you understand what's actually happening

109
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,366
so what does Buddhism say really occurs when you die

110
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:33,400
three insights that challenge everything

111
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,566
most people believe first

112
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:37,900
there's no eternal soul departing your body

113
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,800
the Buddha taught that what we call self is actually 5

114
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,600
ever changing processes

115
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,000
picture a whirlpool in a river

116
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,100
it has a recognizable pattern

117
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,533
seems like a thing

118
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:02,166
but it's actually just water moving in a particular way

119
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:04,600
when the whirlpool dissolves

120
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,133
what dies

121
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,933
nothing substantial was ever there

122
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:11,666
second death is transformation

123
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:15,066
not termination what continues is your karmic stream

124
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,033
the momentum of your actions

125
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,733
thoughts and intentions

126
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:21,700
as we explored in our video on Karma

127
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,400
this isn't about cosmic punishment or reward

128
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,500
but natural cause and effect

129
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,200
like a wave traveling across the ocean

130
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,166
carrying energy from one shore to another

131
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,533
the water changes but the wave pattern continues

132
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,666
third how you experience death

133
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,533
depends entirely on understanding these truths

134
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,766
as the Dhammapada teaches

135
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,566
those who recognize the impermanent nature of selfhood

136
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:59,033
approach death with clarity

137
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:00,600
and even curiosity

138
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,866
those clinging to the illusion of a permanent self

139
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:06,133
experience confusion and terror

140
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,200
as that illusion dissolves

141
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,866
but here's what initially confused me most

142
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:14,400
in my research different Buddhist traditions

143
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,500
seem to give completely different answers about death

144
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:20,900
at first I thought they were contradicting each other

145
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:24,366
then I realized something profound

146
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,833
they're not giving different answers

147
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,500
they're answering different questions

148
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,966
the same questions every dying person asks

149
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,100
during my years studying Buddhist death practices

150
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,300
I kept encountering the same pattern

151
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,300
every tradition I studied

152
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,566
seemed to address specific fears

153
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,533
specific questions that arise when someone faces death

154
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:53,800
and honestly these were exactly the questions

155
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,666
that kept me awake at night after my father died

156
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,100
let me show you what I mean

157
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,866
by drawing from documented accounts

158
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:03,000
of how accomplished Buddhist masters

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,300
have approached death

160
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,166
demonstrating different aspects of these four

161
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:11,133
universal questions that every dying person faces

162
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,233
question 1:

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
will it hurt

164
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,400
in the Thai forest tradition

165
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,733
when masters like Ajahn Chah were dying

166
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,600
they would often

167
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,366
turn their final days into teaching opportunities

168
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:27,166
as Ajahn Chah's body was failing

169
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,300
from complications of diabetes

170
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,000
instead of distress

171
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,266
he demonstrated something remarkable

172
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,300
he would tell his students

173
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,433
watch carefully

174
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,933
see how the body returns to its elements

175
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:41,600
this old cart is falling apart

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,200
but what was driving it continues on

177
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:46,966
this is Theravada

178
00:08:46,966 --> 00:08:49,500
Buddhism's answer to what dying feels like

179
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,266
they map it precisely first

180
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:55,533
your body systems fail temperature drops

181
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:57,533
physical sensations fade

182
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,933
then emotional reactivity diminishes

183
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,000
as sensation withdraws

184
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:07,233
recognition of familiar faces and places disappears

185
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:08,966
as perception dissolves

186
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,600
memories and plans lose coherence

187
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,566
as mental formations scatter

188
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,666
finally consciousness itself

189
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,966
transitions from its embodied state

190
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,466
Ajahn Chah would describe this process

191
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:23,300
with characteristic directness

192
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:35,900
his students watched as he demonstrated exactly

193
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:39,166
what thousands of Theravada practitioners had observed

194
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,133
before him

195
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,300
the peaceful dissolution of what was never permanent

196
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,166
anyway

197
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:48,100
for these practitioners death isn't foreign territory

198
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,266
they've been watching these same processes

199
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:52,433
arise and pass away every day

200
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:56,066
in meditation as the Dhammapada continues

201
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,800
when one sees this with wisdom

202
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,166
one turns away from suffering

203
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,800
Theravada answers the fear of pain

204
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:11,500
question 2:

205
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,366
in Tibetan tradition

206
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,766
masters like Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche

207
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:22,133
have demonstrated something extraordinary

208
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:25,666
when this revered teacher was dying in 1991

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,500
instead of losing awareness

210
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:30,500
witnesses reported he seemed to become more lucid

211
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,666
more present according to his students

212
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,100
Khyentse

213
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,666
Rinpoche remained in meditation posture for three days

214
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,766
after clinical death was declared

215
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:41,766
his body showed no signs of decay

216
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,666
and the area around his heart remained warm

217
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,566
exactly as Tibetan texts describe

218
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,266
during the clear light dissolution process

219
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,600
this is Tibetan Buddhism's answer

220
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,200
yes you can maintain full awareness through death

221
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,866
if you understand the process

222
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,966
the Bardo Thödol states

223
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:14,200
Khyentse Rinpoche's students

224
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,800
described his final days as a living demonstration

225
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,900
of these teachings

226
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:20,766
though his body was clearly failing

227
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:24,666
his awareness seemed to expand rather than contract

228
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,066
the Bardo Thödol  instructs

229
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,466
"this luminosity is your true nature

230
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,500
rest in this recognition"

231
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,300
this is exactly what Tibetan practitioners call

232
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,000
conscious dying maintaining awareness through stages

233
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,600
that most people experience

234
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,733
in confusion and fear

235
00:11:45,866 --> 00:11:48,433
Khyentse Rinpoche's three day meditation

236
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:49,866
after clinical death

237
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,200
became legendary among Tibetan Buddhists

238
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,966
as proof that consciousness

239
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,266
can navigate the dying process

240
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:02,533
with complete lucidity

241
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,666
Tibetan answers the fear of unconsciousness

242
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,800
question 3

243
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:18,566
Zen masters have historically

244
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:21,466
approached death with remarkable equanimity

245
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:26,100
sometimes even humor The 15th century master Ikkyu

246
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,133
facing his final moments composed this death poem

247
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:46,466
even more striking was the 13th century master Dōgen

248
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,066
who when asked for final words

249
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:49,833
simply said:

250
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,566
then he passed away in perfect silence

251
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:02,933
this is Zen Buddhism's most radical answer

252
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,100
there is no death because there is no self

253
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,000
to die

254
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,833
what we call dying is actually the illusion of selfhood

255
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,066
finally dissolving to reveal what was always true

256
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:17,766
as Dōgen taught in the Shōbōgenzō

257
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:20,300
"to study the self is to forget the self"

258
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:23,666
these Zen masters embodied the teaching

259
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:27,133
that death is the ultimate revelation of no self

260
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:29,666
their calm acceptance

261
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,533
even laughter in the face of death

262
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,400
wasn't denial

263
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,700
it was recognition

264
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,166
nothing real was ending

265
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,600
because nothing substantial had ever begun

266
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:44,600
Zen answers the fear of identity

267
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:47,366
question 4

268
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,800
Pure Land Buddhism offers perhaps

269
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,400
the most accessible approach to conscious dying

270
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,866
in countless documented cases throughout history

271
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:09,966
ordinary practitioners with no special training

272
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:12,933
have died peacefully through simple faith and chanting

273
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
the practice is beautifully simple

274
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,900
sincere calling upon Amitabha

275
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,966
Buddha's name with complete trust

276
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,800
no elaborate spiritual accomplishments required

277
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,566
just wholehearted surrender

278
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:30,766
to Buddha's infinite compassion

279
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,300
Pure Land founder Shinran taught something radical

280
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,966
this isn't just faith it's recognition that

281
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:48,900
Buddha's compassion extends even to those who feel

282
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,700
completely unworthy

283
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,633
in Japanese Pure Land temples

284
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:56,500
you'll find countless records of ordinary people

285
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,800
farmers merchants

286
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,933
even those who lived difficult lives

287
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,766
who died with serene expressions

288
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,300
while chanting Amitabha's name

289
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,200
their faces radiated peace

290
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:11,966
because they had surrendered

291
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:14,400
completely to something greater than their own

292
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,100
spiritual accomplishments

293
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,500
pure land answers the fear of unworthiness

294
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:23,366
these documented examples from Buddhist history

295
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:25,266
demonstrate that all four approaches

296
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:26,933
aren't contradictory

297
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:28,600
their complimentary

298
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,100
answers to the different fears and questions

299
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,900
every conscious being faces when approaching death

300
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:35,600
now

301
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,900
when I first Learned about these different approaches

302
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,700
I'll admit I was skeptical

303
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,633
how could ancient meditation teachers

304
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:45,733
possibly know what actually happens during death

305
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:49,266
they didn't have EEGs or brain scanners

306
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:51,966
they couldn't measure consciousness scientifically

307
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,966
that's when I discovered something

308
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,566
that shook my scientific worldview

309
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,700
here's where my Buddhist death studies

310
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,966
took an unexpected turn

311
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:09,766
that honestly challenged my materialist assumptions

312
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:13,200
I was ready to treat these teachings as beautiful

313
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,000
metaphors inspiring philosophy

314
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,966
comforting mythology then I encountered the research

315
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,066
Dr. Pim van Lommel a Dutch cardiologist

316
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,700
spent decades studying patients

317
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,166
who'd been clinically dead

318
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:28,900
no heartbeat no brain activity

319
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,400
but returned with detailed memories of the experience

320
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,800
what surprised me van Lomel said

321
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,100
was how consistently

322
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,066
these accounts matched descriptions

323
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,100
in ancient Buddhist texts

324
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,166
patients described leaving their bodies

325
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:46,600
moving through tunnels of light

326
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,066
encountering spiritual beings

327
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:52,033
the progression was almost identical

328
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:55,800
to what Tibetan Buddhism calls the Bardo journey

329
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,900
Dr. Eben Alexander a

330
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,366
Harvard neurosurgeon discovered this personally

331
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:04,033
when bacterial meningitis left him in a coma

332
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:07,166
for seven days with zero neocortex function

333
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,466
the brain region

334
00:17:08,466 --> 00:17:10,933
supposedly responsible for consciousness

335
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:13,100
yet he returned with vivid memories

336
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,666
of journeying through remarkable realms

337
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:17,966
guided by loving presences

338
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:21,633
the experience was entirely consistent

339
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:23,633
with what contemplatives have described

340
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:26,266
for centuries Alexander said

341
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:30,200
it suggests consciousness may be fundamental to reality

342
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,000
not just produced by the brain

343
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:36,166
now not all scientists agree with these interpretations

344
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,300
many argue that near death experiences

345
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,166
can be explained by brain chemistry

346
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:44,000
during cardiac arrest residual neural activity

347
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:48,400
oxygen deprivation or neurotransmitter release

348
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,500
the debate continues in academic circles

349
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,500
and we should acknowledge

350
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,300
these alternative explanations

351
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,033
but what really convinced me

352
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,900
was talking to hospice workers

353
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,633
who observe death daily Dr. Christopher Kerr

354
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:07,100
has documented thousands of cases

355
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,300
where dying patients

356
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,200
report coherent visions of deceased loved ones

357
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:12,866
spiritual realms

358
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:15,666
and guided journeys that bring profound peace

359
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:17,500
Buddhist patients

360
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,500
consistently demonstrate the most conscious deaths

361
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,133
hospice nurse Sarah Martinez told me

362
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:25,800
they navigate the process

363
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
like they have detailed road maps

364
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,800
they describe stages sensations

365
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,300
and experiences that match their teachings exactly

366
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,233
the convergence was undeniable

367
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,833
modern neuroscience was documenting phenomena

368
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,766
that ancient Buddhist practitioners

369
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:44,000
had mapped through pure

370
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,933
contemplative investigation

371
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:47,600
but that's when I realized

372
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,900
I was missing the most important question

373
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:55,600
so what? what does this actually mean for how I live?

374
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,566
how I approach my own inevitable death

375
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,833
that's when everything clicked into place

376
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,100
and in a way that changed my life completely

377
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,200
six months into my death studies

378
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,966
I was meditating one evening

379
00:19:11,966 --> 00:19:14,033
still carrying that weight of death anxiety

380
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:15,400
from my father's passing

381
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:18,133
I'd Learned all these Buddhist theories

382
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,000
but I was still fundamentally terrified

383
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,166
then something shifted

384
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:26,033
I was reflecting on what these masters demonstrated

385
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:27,733
about the clear light of death

386
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:31,300
consciousness recognizing its own essential nature

387
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,933
suddenly a question arose that changed everything

388
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:36,766
what if this clear light

389
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,900
isn't something that appears only at death

390
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,500
I sat there in meditation

391
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,566
and for the first time I really noticed

392
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:46,900
the awareness that was observing my thoughts

393
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,166
not the thoughts themselves

394
00:19:49,466 --> 00:19:51,900
but the space in which they were appearing

395
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,500
this luminous knowing presence

396
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,433
that seemed completely

397
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:58,900
untouched by whatever was arising in it

398
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,766
and it hit me this was it

399
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:04,666
this was what all the death teachings

400
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,933
were pointing toward

401
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:08,266
the awareness that could observe thoughts

402
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:09,600
arising and passing

403
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,166
was the same awareness that could observe the body

404
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,500
arising and passing

405
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,400
the consciousness that remained constant

406
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,566
through all the changes of life

407
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,733
was the same consciousness that would navigate death

408
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:25,233
I wasn't learning about some distant future experience

409
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:27,966
I was discovering what was already here

410
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:29,866
already indestructible

411
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,366
already free from the whole drama of birth and death

412
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,566
here's something practical you can try right now

413
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:39,766
when you notice a thought arise and dissolve

414
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:43,400
in meditation you are rehearsing death itself

415
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:46,866
every exhale can be a micro death

416
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,166
this is practice here and now

417
00:20:49,566 --> 00:20:51,600
if you haven't started meditating yet

418
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,400
check out our guide on how to meditate like a pro

419
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:57,633
it's the perfect foundation for understanding

420
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,400
what we're exploring tonight

421
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,666
every time I meditated and thoughts quieted down

422
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,366
I was practicing death recognition

423
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,400
every moment I observed emotions arise and pass away

424
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,900
without identification

425
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:15,333
I was rehearsing the Ultimate Letting Go

426
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,966
every instant I recognized awareness itself

427
00:21:18,966 --> 00:21:20,466
rather than its contents

428
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,966
I was preparing for the recognition

429
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,200
that transcends death entirely

430
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:32,400
this is why studying death transforms how you live

431
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,266
not because it prepares you for some future event

432
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:36,966
but because it reveals

433
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:39,666
the indestructible nature of consciousness

434
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,400
operating right now

435
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:44,066
the fear didn't disappear overnight

436
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:46,133
but something fundamental shifted

437
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:49,433
death stopped being this terrifying unknown

438
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,966
and became curious

439
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:54,500
like what will it be like

440
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,233
when all this mental activity finally quiets down

441
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,166
completely

442
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:01,000
what will pure awareness recognize about itself

443
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,400
when there's nothing left to distract it

444
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:07,033
whether through Theravada observation of impermanence

445
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:09,166
Zen recognition of no self

446
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:11,900
pure land surrender to Grace

447
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:15,333
or Tibetan navigation of consciousness states

448
00:22:15,766 --> 00:22:17,766
all Buddhist death practices

449
00:22:17,766 --> 00:22:19,766
point toward the same discovery

450
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,366
the awareness that can consciously navigate death

451
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:25,166
can consciously navigate any experience

452
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:29,200
understanding death doesn't just prepare you for dying

453
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,566
it awakens you to the miracle of being conscious

454
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:33,800
in the first place

455
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,766
but thinking back to my father's death

456
00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:38,700
I realized I'd found something

457
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,566
he would have wanted me to know

458
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:44,100
that the love connecting us was part of this same

459
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,433
indestructible awareness death couldn't touch what

460
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:50,466
was most essential about our relationship

461
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,233
we've explored

462
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:59,200
Buddhism's understanding of the moment of death itself

463
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:02,766
those four questions every dying person faces

464
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:06,600
and how different traditions provide navigation tools

465
00:23:06,766 --> 00:23:08,333
for conscious departure

466
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:11,766
but we've only examined the beginning of the journey

467
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:13,066
what happens

468
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:15,666
after consciousness separates from the body

469
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,400
this is where Buddhist teaching becomes truly

470
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,600
mind bending

471
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,366
according to Tibetan tradition

472
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:24,166
after the clear light moment

473
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:27,633
consciousness enters what may be the strangest journey

474
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:29,533
any being can experience

475
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,966
the Bardo of Dharmata

476
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,366
where thoughts manifest instantly as reality

477
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,900
where karmic visions arise with overwhelming intensity

478
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:42,400
where rebirth conditions take shape

479
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,566
according to patterns accumulated across lifetimes

480
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,433
we touched on this in our exploration of the Tibetan

481
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:51,766
Book of the dead but next week

482
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:54,500
we'll go much deeper into this mysterious journey

483
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,500
this intermediate state may last up to 49 days

484
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:58,800
but

485
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,700
here's the revelation that will guide our next episode

486
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,233
what if the after death journey

487
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:05,600
isn't something that begins

488
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,933
when the heart stops

489
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,233
but the very fabric of consciousness you're living in

490
00:24:10,233 --> 00:24:11,200
right now

491
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,900
think about it in dreams

492
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,533
your thoughts become the reality you experience

493
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:18,600
in strong emotions

494
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:22,066
your inner state creates the world you perceive

495
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:23,766
in meditation

496
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,166
mental projections arise and dissolve

497
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,400
like living beings

498
00:24:29,766 --> 00:24:30,866
what if consciousness

499
00:24:30,866 --> 00:24:33,033
recognizing its own creative power

500
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:35,666
without the filter of physical embodiment

501
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,833
is exactly what's happening in every moment

502
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:39,900
of awareness

503
00:24:42,366 --> 00:24:45,366
next week we'll explore how thoughts become reality

504
00:24:45,366 --> 00:24:46,766
in intermediate states

505
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:50,066
why some beings find immediate rebirth

506
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,466
while others wander the full journey

507
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:54,533
and the possibility

508
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,600
that you're already navigating Bardo states

509
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,400
without recognizing them

510
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:04,866
if tonight's exploration expanded your understanding

511
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:07,166
subscribe and hit the notification bell

512
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:08,800
share this with anyone

513
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,066
curious about consciousness and death

514
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,666
tell us in the comments which of the four questions

515
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:18,733
resonates most with your own thoughts about death

516
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,300
how has learning about conscious dying

517
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,733
changed your perspective on mortality

518
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,800
remember consciousness is stranger than death

519
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,066
and perhaps stranger than life itself

520
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,766
the exploration we're beginning together

521
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:36,300
isn't just about understanding death

522
00:25:36,766 --> 00:25:40,266
it's about awakening to the nature of awareness itself

523
00:25:41,766 --> 00:25:43,700
until next time stay curious

524
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,666
stay wise

525
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,533
the mystery deepens next week

526
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:50,400
and what we'll discover about consciousness

527
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,400
might reveal that death is not the end of the story

528
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:58,166
but the beginning of understanding what we really are
