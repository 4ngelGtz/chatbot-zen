00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,959

in 1950 at just 15 years old the Dalai

199
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,560
Lama assumed full political power as

tibet's head of state the boy who had

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,640
suddenly thrust onto the world stage

203
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,920
facing one of the greatest challenges in

tibet's history this early Assumption of

205
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,560
leadership shaped the Dalai Lama's life

206
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,040
and Mission it forced him to balance

207
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,200
Spiritual Development with political

208
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,279
responsibility a duality that would

209
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,279
define his role in the global

210
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:36,040
stage yet the challenges were just

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,760
also reshape tibet's

1959 Tibet already under increasing

216
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:54,079
Chinese control was a powder keg ready

217
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,839
to

00:09:54,079 --> 00:10:01,160
explode on March 17th under cover of

Darkness the 20 3-year-old Dalai Lama

220
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,480
disguised himself as a soldier and

221
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,720
slipped out of the norbulinka palace in

222
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,440
Lassa What followed was a perilous

223
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,360
14-day journey across the Himalayas this

224
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,839
wasn't just a political Exile it was the

225
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,720
beginning of a profound

226
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,120
transformation both for the Dalai Lama

227
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,600
and for Global

228
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:28,440
Buddhism upon reaching India the Dalai

229
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,000

as little Lassa but the Dalai Lama

233
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:40,600
wasn't alone tens of thousands of

234
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,880
Tibetans followed him into Exile

235
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,720
creating a diaspora that spread Tibetan

236
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,920
culture and Buddhism far beyond the

237
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,320
Himalayan Plateau it was in Exile that

238
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,000
the Dalai Lama began his emergence as a

239
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,040
global spiritual leader free from the

240
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,480
isolation of Tibet he engaged with the

241
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,600
world in unprecedented ways he traveled

242
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,959
extensively meeting with religious and

243
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,360
political leaders scientists and

244
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,160
intellectuals he spoke at the United

246
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,360
engaged in dialogues with people from

247
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,959
all walks of life in 1989 his efforts

248
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,959
for peace and human rights were

249
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:22,519
recognized with the Nobel Peace Prize

250
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:26,920
this catapulted him onto the world stage

251
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:30,200
amplifying his message of compassion and

252
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,160
nonviolence the dalil Lama's Global e

253
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,519
wasn't just about politics or human

254
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,079
rights it marked the beginning of a new

255
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:39,519
chapter for Buddhism

256
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:42,600
itself as the Dal Lama traveled the

257
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,480
world he brought Tibetan Buddhism with

258
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,560
him his teachings resonated with people

259
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,160
far beyond traditional Buddhist

260
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,399
communities sparking a surge of interest

261
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,279
in Buddhist philosophy and practices in

262
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,720
the

263
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,760
west the Dalai Lam Exile while born from

264
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,720
tragedy became a catalyst for the

265
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:04,800
globalis ation of Tibetan Buddhism it

266
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:08,600
transformed a regional spiritual leader

267
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,160
into a worldwide icon of peace and

268
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,680
compassion but how exactly did the Dal

269
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,880
Lama bridge the gap between East and

270
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,920
West to understand that we need to

271
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,480
explore his unique approach to adapting

272
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,480
ancient wisdom for the modern

273
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,079
world as the Dalai Lama stepped onto the

274
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,800
global stage he faced a unique challenge

275
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:35,440
how could he make the ancient wisdom of

276
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,000
Tibetan Buddhism relevant to the modern

277
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,560
Western

278
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,360
World the Dalai Lama tackled this

279
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,040
challenge with a revolutionary approach

280
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,360
instead of Simply bringing Tibetan

281
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,320
Buddhist practices to the West he became

282
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,839
a cultural translator shaping ancient

283
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,079
Concepts to connect with modern

284
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,519
Minds in his public talks the Dalai Lama

285
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:59,800
emphasized Universal themes like

286
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,199
compassion mindfulness

287
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,480
and the nature of Consciousness he

288
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:06,720
presented these ideas not as exotic

289
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,560
religious Concepts but as practical

290
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,880
tools for living a more fulfilling life

291
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,680
but perhaps most striking was the Dalai

292
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,920
Lama's openness to science unlike some

293
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,320
religious leaders who view science with

294
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,760
suspicion he embraced it

295
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,720
wholeheartedly if scientific analysis

296
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,560
were conclusively to demonstrate certain

297
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,199
claims in Buddhism to be false then we

298
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,279
must accept the findings of Science and

299
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:33,839
abandon those

300
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:37,560
claims this statement encapsulates the

301
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:40,519
Dalai Lama's unique approach he views

302
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,600
Buddhism not as a fixed Dogma but as a

303
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,320
method of inquiry that can and should

304
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,519
evolve based on new

305
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,920
knowledge this openness led to

306
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,240
groundbreaking

307
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,320
collaborations the doai Lama invited

308
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,320
neuroscientists to study the brains of

309
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:59,199
experienced meditators helping to spark

310
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,519
the modern mindfulness movement these

311
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,560
studies contributed to the explosion of

312
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,839
interest in meditation and mindfulness

313
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,759

314

315
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,639
Dalai Lamas bridge building went beyond

316
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,759
science he engaged in Interfaith

317
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,519

318
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,800
Buddhism and other world

319
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,519
religions through these exchanges he

320
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,360
emphasized the shared values of

321
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,120
compassion ethics and the pursuit of

322
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,920
inner peace across different Faith

323
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,480
Traditions by presenting buddh ideas in

a universal often secular language the

325
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,920
Dalai Lama made Eastern wisdom

326
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,480
accessible to Western

327
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,880
audiences he showed that practices like

328
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,399
meditation and compassion cultivation

329
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,279
weren't just for monks and monasteries

330
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,040
they were valuable tools for anyone

332
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,440

East and West Tradition and modernity

334
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,480

have led to a new era of Buddhist unity

Dalai Lama's most profound impact was on

to Foster Unity among different Buddhist

revolutionary he created dialogue

had once been whisked away from his

village to lead a nation had become a

395
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,320
global spiritual leader transcending

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,440
cultural National and religious

397
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,200
boundaries he had not only preserved

398
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,400
Tibetan Buddhism in Exile but it also

399
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,280
sparked a worldwide Renaissance of

400
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,000
Buddhist thought and

practice the Dalai Lama's Journey from

stage represents more than just one

404
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,919
man's life it embodies the power of

405
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,880
compassion to bridge divides the ability

406
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,840
of ancient wisdom to address modern

407
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,080
challenges and the potential for

408
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,760
Spiritual teachings to Foster Global

409
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,240
Unity but every great story has its

410
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,600
challenges and

411
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,720
controversies now let's explore how he

412
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,720
has reshaped Buddhism for today's

413
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,400
world the Dalai Lama's influence has

414
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,480
reshaped the landscape of global

415
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,080
Buddhism in ways that were

416
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,039
unimaginable just a few decades ago to

417
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,919
understand the Dalai Lama's impact on

418
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:41,400
global Buddhism we need to look at three

419
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,840
key areas the modernization of Buddhist

420
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,960
thought the globalization of Tibetan

421
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,520
Buddhism and the emergence of engaged

422
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,000
Buddhism first the Dalai Lama has been

423
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,559
at the Forefront of modernizing Buddhist

424
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,480
thought his openness to science and

425
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,799
dialogue with modern disciplines has

426
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,400
encouraged Buddhists worldwide to engage

427
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,200
engage with contemporary issues from

428
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,200
climate change to artificial

429
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,440
intelligence we now see Buddhist leaders

430
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,200
and communities actively participating

431
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,880
in global discussions armed with both

432
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,360
ancient wisdom and modern

433
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,520
knowledge this modernization hasn't

434
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,400
diluted Buddhism it has made it more

435
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,200
relevant and accessible around the world

436
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,400
the Dalai Lama's presence has also

437
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,320
sparked an unprecedented spread of

438
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,240
Tibetan Buddhism everywhere what was

439
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,159
once a tradition conf ined to the

440
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,360
Himalayan region is now practiced on

441
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:35,840
every continent since the Dalai Lam

442
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,600
Exile in

443
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,520
1959 the number of Tibetan Buddhist

444
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:44,720
centers in the west has grown

445
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,159
exponentially today you can find Tibetan

446
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,240
Buddhist teachings and practices in

447
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:52,000
cities from New York to Sydney from

448
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,799
London to S Pao the Dal Lama made

449
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,720
Tibetan Buddhism accessible he showed us

450
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,480
that these ancient practices could be

451
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,880
meaningful in our modern lives

452
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,400
but perhaps the most profound impact has

453
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,080
been the rise of what's called engaged

454
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,640
Buddhism a movement that applies

455
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:13,840
Buddhist insights to social political

456
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,280
and environmental issues inspired by the

457
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,880
Dalai Lamas example Buddhists around the

458
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,480
world are now at the Forefront of

459
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,200
humanitarian and environmental

460
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,280
efforts from meditation programs in

461
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,000
prisons to Buddhist L climate activism

462
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,039
we're seeing a new socially engaged face

463
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,240
of Buddhism compassion without action is

464
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:38,159
just pity we must act to alleviate

465
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,159
suffering wherever we find it this call

466
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:43,120
to action has energized Buddhist

467
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,280
communities globally breaking down the

468
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,559
perceived barrier between spiritual

469
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,159
practice and worldly engagement moreover

470
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,400
the Dalai Lama's emphasis on the core

471
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:59,080
shared values of all Buddhist Traditions

472
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:03,559
has fostered unprecedented cooperation

473
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:05,400
today we see Zen theava and vajana

474
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:07,120
Buddhists working together on global

475
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,320
initiatives in ways that were rare

476
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,799
before his

477
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,799
influence the Dalai Lama's impact on

478
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,840
global Buddhism goes beyond just

479
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:18,000
spreading Tibetan Traditions he has

480
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,559
catalyzed a Renaissance in Buddhist

481
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
thought and practice making it more

482
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:26,520
unified more engaged with the world and

483
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,039
more relevant to the challenges of our

484
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:32,440
time in doing so he has not only ensured

485
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:35,320
the survival of Tibetan Buddhism outside

486
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:38,039
Tibet but has also played a pivotal role

487
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,840
in shaping buddhism's place in the 21st

488
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:43,400
century and

489
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,919
beyond the Daly Lama's influence on

490
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,880
Buddhism has been transformative but not

491
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,080
without

492
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,960
controversy let's also consider how

493
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,960
different Buddhist Traditions view his

494
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,960
impact while the Dalai Lama's influence

495
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,240
on global Buddhism is undeniable it's

496
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,159
important to remember that he represents

497
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,080
just one school of Buddhist thought albe

498
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,159
it a highly visible one to get a fuller

499
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,880
picture we need to explore how other

500
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:17,120
Buddhist Traditions view the Dalai Lama

501
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,159
and his impact on Buddhism as a whole

502
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,080
let's start with theava Buddhism the

503
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:24,159
dominant form of Buddhism in Southeast

504
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:27,919
Asian countries like Thailand Sri Lanka

505
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:31,000
and Myanmar Dr Aon chai a respected

506
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,840
theava monk said we respect the Dalai

507
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,919
Lama as a great Buddhist teacher his

508
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,559
emphasis on compassion and mindfulness

509
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,480
resonates with our

510
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:42,840
tradition however some of the tantric

511
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,600
practices in Tibetan Buddhism are not

512
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,760
part of our path this perspective

513
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,000
highlights both the common ground and

514
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,039
the differences between Buddhist

515
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,440
schools while there's mutual respect

516
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,559
there are also distinct practices and

517
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,679
beliefs now let's turn to Zen Buddhism a

518
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,760
hyana School popular in East Asia and

519
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:06,880
increasingly in the west a zen master

520
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,480
once said the Dalai Lama's openness to

521
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,159
science and his ability to communicate

522
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,960
Buddhist Concepts to a global audience

523
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,440
have been beneficial for all of Buddhism

524
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,840
however our approach to meditation and

525
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,559
Enlightenment differs in some ways from

526
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,720
the Tibetan

527
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:25,760
tradition this Zen perspective

528
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,919
appreciates the Dalai Lama's role in

529
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,919
modernizing Buddhism while acknowledging

530
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,919
the diversity within Buddhist

531
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:37,000
practices pure land Buddhism another

532
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,360
Mahayana School popular in East Asia

533
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,039
offers yet another

534
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,640
perspective a pure land Buddhist scholar

535
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:47,240
said the Dalai Lama's emphasis on

536
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,559
compassion aligns well with pure land

537
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,679
teachings his Global influence has

538
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:54,360
opened doors for all Buddhist Traditions

539
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,080
to share their messages more widely

540
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,799
however our focus on faith in amapa

541
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,320
Buddha differs from the medit ation

542
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,720
heavy approach of Tibetan

543
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,000
Buddhism these varied perspectives

544
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,679
reveal a complex web of Buddhist thought

545
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,600
while there's widespread respect for the

546
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,520
Dalai Lama there's also a recognition of

547
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,080
the rich diversity within Buddhism

548
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,480
importantly the Dalai Lama himself has

549
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,720
always acknowledged and respected this

550
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,600
diversity he often stresses that he

551
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,640
speaks primarily for Tibetan Buddhism

552
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,960
and encourages people to explore other

553
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,919
Buddhist Traditions Buddhism has many

554
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,520
different philosophies and methods this

555
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,520
diversity is valuable and

556
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,880
necessary as people have different

557
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,679
dispositions this mutual respect and

558
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,960
acknowledgement of diversity have been

559
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,640
key to the Dalai Lama's unifying

560
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,679
influence he has managed to highlight

561
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,320
the common ethical and philosophical

562
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:52,039
foundations of Buddhism while respecting

563
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,320
the unique aspects of each

564
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,440
tradition as a result we've seen

565
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,000
unprecedented collaboration between

566
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:03,080
Buddhist schools on issues like climate

567
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,600

distinct identities and

570
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,440
practices the Dalai Lama's impact isn't

571
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,320
about making all of Buddhism the same

572
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,000
it's about encouraging Mutual

573
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,000
understanding and cooperation among

Buddhist values of wisdom and compassion

576
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,480
as we reflect on the Dalai Lama's

577
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,679
journey and his impact it's essential to

578
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,279
consider the challenges he faces and the

579
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,720
uncertainties of the

580
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,720
future despite his Global influence the

581
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,960
road ahead presents many

582
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,120
questions some accuse him of being too

583
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,600
political While others argue he's not

584
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,679
political enough in his advocacy for

585
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,000
Tibet the Dalai Lama walks a tight rout

586
00:25:54,679 --> 00:26:00,679
he must balance his role as a spiritual

587
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,080
leader with the expectations of Tibetans

588
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:06,159
who see him as their political

589
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:08,480
hope this dual role as both spiritual

590
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:12,000
and political leader has led to complex

591
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:15,000
diplomatic situations many world leaders

592
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,320
wary of antagonizing China have become

593
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,520
hesitant to meet with him

594
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,000
officially each meeting with a head of

595
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,960
state Sparks diplomatic tensions

596
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,799
highlighting the ongoing challenge of

597
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,559
maintaining Global influence while

598
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:29,559
advocating for Tibet

599
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,880
the most pressing challenge lies in the

600
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,360
future the question of succession the

601
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,159
Dalai Lama has suggested he might be the

602
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,159
last in his line or his successor could

603
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,480
be chosen in a non-traditional way the

604
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:47,360
institution of The Dalai Lama has served

605
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,520
its purpose more importantly I feel it

606
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,360
is better that a centuries old tradition

607
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,640
should cease at the time of a popular

608
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,240
Dalai

609
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,080
Lama this statement has sparked intense

610
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,399
debate both within and outside the

611
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,600
Tibetan Buddhist community

612
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:05,200
it raises profound questions about the

613
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:08,120
future of Tibetan Buddhism and its

614
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,559
leadership adding to the complexity the

615
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,440
Chinese government insists that it has

616
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,320
the right to approve the next Dalai Lama

617
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,520
setting the stage for a potential

618
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,520
conflict over his

619
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,120
successor Beyond succession there are

620
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,080
other challenges how will Tibetan

621
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,880
Buddhism maintain its authenticity while

622
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,080
continuing to adapt to the modern world

623
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,650
how will it navigate the digital age and

Society these questions don't have easy

627
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,600
answers but they highlight the ongoing

628
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:43,600
evolution of Buddhism in the global

629
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:47,200

633
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:57,640
will continue to be felt regardless of

634
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:00,039
what happens to the institution itself

635
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,720
his emphasis is on compassion his

636
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:04,640
bridging of Science and spirituality and

reflect on what we've

learned we've traced the path of a young

663
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,880
boy from a small Tibetan Village to

664
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:20,720

preserved and adapted tobet Buddhism in
