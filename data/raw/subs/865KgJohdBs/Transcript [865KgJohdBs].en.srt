1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,600
what if I told you

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,466
that one of Buddhism's greatest saints

3
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:13,100
was once a mass murderer

4
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:16,133
a young man so consumed by rage

5
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,100
that he calls down a supernatural storm

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,533
that crushes a house during a wedding Celebration

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,400
35 people die crushed under collapsing beams and stone

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,300
but no one expected that this same killer

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,500
would one day be revered as a saint

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,600
a master

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,400
whose songs are still sung in Tibetan valleys today

12
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:38,266
how does someone go from taking lives to saving souls

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,966
how do you come back from that kind of darkness

14
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:44,200
today we're telling the most shocking redemption story

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,533
in Buddhist history

16
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:48,066
the tale of Milarepa

17
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:51,166
the boy who learned sorcery and became a saint

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,600
I'm warning you right now

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,866
this story gets dark before it gets light

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,300
really dark

21
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,600
are you ready to meet the saint who was once a killer

22
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:03,566
welcome back to Buddha's wisdom

23
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:04,233
I'm Matt

24
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,733
and today we're starting something completely different

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,466
you know how we recently

26
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:10,733
explored the Monkey King's battle with Buddha

27
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,900
well if you thought Sun Wukong had anger issues

28
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:17,400
Milarepa makes him look like a meditation teacher

29
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,733
most Buddhist stories follow a predictable pattern

30
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,300
someone seeks wisdom finds a teacher

31
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,000
practices meditation achieves peace

32
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:29,600
nice and tidy Milarepa's story

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,933
it starts with revenge blood and supernatural murder

34
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,800
then it gets worse here's why his story matters

35
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,600
especially

36
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,866
if you've ever done something you deeply regret

37
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,166
Milarepa proves that no mistake is too big

38
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,900
no darkness too deep

39
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:48,600
and no past too violent for transformation

40
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,433
his own life shows

41
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:52,200
that even a murderer can become a Buddha

42
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:54,866
his journey shows us that redemption

43
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:56,500
isn't about being perfect

44
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,700
it's about what you do after you completely mess up

45
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,033
Milarepa's mistake

46
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:04,100
was beyond anything you can imagine

47
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,100
over the next three episodes

48
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,566
we'll follow his path from sorcerer to saint

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,933
Today we're covering the darkness

50
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,700
the family betrayal that created a killer

51
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,800
and the moment everything changed

52
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:18,766
by the end of this episode

53
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:21,200
you'll understand how someone becomes so angry

54
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,100
they're willing to murder dozens of people with magic

55
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:26,866
but you'll also see the first spark of hope

56
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:28,366
that could become enlightenment

57
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,366
it all started with a boy

58
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:33,500
born into material prosperity and familial bliss

59
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:36,000
that's about to be destroyed forever

60
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:42,900
our story begins in the mid 11th century

61
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,466
in a place called Gungthang

62
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,900
a prosperous region of western Tibet

63
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,300
near the border with Nepal

64
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:51,800
here lived a boy named Mila Thöpaga

65
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,600
which means a joy to hear

66
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,466
his early life was exactly that

67
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:57,466
pure joy

68
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,500
his father Sherab Gyaltsen

69
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,300
wasn't your average Tibetan farmer

70
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:03,200
this guy was a successful merchant

71
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,200
the kind of man who owned vast fields

72
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,900
herds of yaks and sheep

73
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,000
and a three story stone mansion with carved

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,100
wooden balconies

75
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:12,600
we're talking serious money here

76
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:15,066
the kind that makes you village royalty

77
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,766
his mother Nyangtsa Kargyen

78
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,233
was known throughout the region

79
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,066
for her intelligence and beauty

80
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:24,900
she came from an influential family herself

81
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,700
so this marriage combined two powerhouses

82
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:30,733
Young Mila had everything a child could want

83
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,133
loving parents a beautiful home

84
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,566
and a little sister named Peta Gönkyi

85
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:37,933
who followed him everywhere with sparkling eyes

86
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,566
in Tibet household

87
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:40,866
wealth and honor were everything

88
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:43,366
losing both meant not just poverty

89
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:46,200
it meant shame that stuck to your name for generations

90
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,133
but here's what made this family special

91
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,900
they weren't wealthy jerks

92
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:53,233
Sherab Gyaltsen was respected

93
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,466
because he was fair and generous

94
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:58,533
he helped struggling farmers through harsh winters

95
00:03:58,866 --> 00:03:59,833
settled disputes

96
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,133
with wisdom that impressed village elders

97
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,800
and was considered a pillar of the community

98
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:07,466
the villagers would nod respectfully

99
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:08,800
when the family passed

100
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:11,333
children would bow to Mila's father

101
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,833
merchants would seek his advice on trade routes

102
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,100
and fair prices

103
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:19,500
for seven years Mila lived in this bubble of security

104
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,600
he thought this was how life worked

105
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:24,866
you had family you had wealth

106
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,733
you had respect

107
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:29,900
he had no idea that life could be cruel

108
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,700
but then everything changed

109
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,566
in a single devastating week

110
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:36,766
Sherab Gyaltsen fell ill

111
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:38,300
with a fever that wouldn't break

112
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:41,233
his strong body which had survived mountain winters

113
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,000
and dangerous trade expeditions

114
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,333
began to waste away before their eyes

115
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:48,766
in those days there were no hospitals

116
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:49,900
no medicine

117
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:53,300
no way to fight whatever was consuming him from within

118
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:57,933
as he lay dying knowing his time was running out

119
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,366
Sherab Gyaltsen

120
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,500
made a decision that would doom his family

121
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:05,133
he called his brother and sister in law to his bedside

122
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,700
promise me he whispered

123
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,866
with his final breaths

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,733
you'll protect my wife and children

125
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:13,733
guard my wealth for my son until he comes of age

126
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:15,933
treat them as you would your own family

127
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,533
his brother clasped his hand and swore sacred oaths

128
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,800
his sister in law wept

129
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,100
and promised faithfully to honor his wishes

130
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:25,700
they looked him in the eye and lied

131
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,466
when Sherab Gyaltsen died 7 year old

132
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:30,766
Mila

133
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:32,900
thought his uncle and aunt would keep their promise

134
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,633
he was about to learn that some people will do anything

135
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:38,066
for money even destroy a family

136
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,400
the transformation began the day after the funeral

137
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,400
Mila's uncle and aunt didn't waste time

138
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:50,100
the uncle moved into the family mansion

139
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,400
like he owned it because suddenly he did

140
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,800
we need to manage the estate properly

141
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:57,933
the uncle announced to the gathered villagers

142
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,966
for the boy's own good of course

143
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:03,066
the villagers nodded it seemed reasonable

144
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,300
responsible even

145
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,233
what the villagers didn't see

146
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,100
was what happened behind closed doors

147
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,200
first the uncle took control of the fields

148
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,966
then the livestock then the servants

149
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:17,900
within weeks everything that belonged to Mila's family

150
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:19,933
now belonged to his uncle

151
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,033
but here's the truly evil part

152
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,200
the uncle and aunt didn't kick the family out

153
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,200
that would have been too obvious

154
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:28,566
instead the uncle turned Mila

155
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:30,066
his mother and little sister Peta

156
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:32,400
into servants in their own home

157
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,500
when I first heard this story

158
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,600
I couldn't believe it yesterday

159
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:39,166
you're the son of the richest man in the village

160
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:40,866
today you're

161
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:41,666
scrubbing floors

162
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,933
for the people who stole everything from you

163
00:06:44,566 --> 00:06:47,033
Mila's mother went from being the lady of the house

164
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,900
to washing clothes by the river

165
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:53,166
this proud intelligent woman was forced to bow her head

166
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,766
and serve the very people who destroyed her life

167
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:58,700
little Peta went from playing with silk dolls

168
00:06:58,766 --> 00:06:59,833
to hauling water buckets

169
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,866
that were too heavy for her small hands

170
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,366
the light slowly faded from her eyes

171
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:06,600
as she watched her family's dignity crumble

172
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,500
as for Mila himself

173
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,733
years later he described it like this

174
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,400
our food was food for dogs

175
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,533
our work was work for donkeys

176
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,733
forced to toil without rest

177
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,266
our limbs became cracked and raw

178
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,466
with only poor food and clothing

179
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,066
we became pale and emaciated

180
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,800
it's impossible to imagine your own relatives

181
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,733
making you live like an animal

182
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,600
but the worst part wasn't the physical suffering

183
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,766
it was the humiliation every day

184
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,266
villagers would see this once proud family

185
00:07:40,366 --> 00:07:42,566
reduced to beggars in their own home

186
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:43,800
and slowly

187
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,133
the villagers sympathy turned to indifference

188
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,966
people have their own problems

189
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:50,400
family disputes become uncomfortable

190
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,166
it's easier to look away

191
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:53,266
meanwhile

192
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:56,133
Mila's uncle and aunt threw parties with stolen money

193
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:58,666
wore fine clothes bought with stolen wealth

194
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,466
and acted like generous benefactors to the community

195
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,833
for three years Nyangtsa Kargyen

196
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,933
tried to reclaim what belonged to her family

197
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,000
she appealed to village elders

198
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,200
she showed them her husband's will

199
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,700
she begged for justice but

200
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,000
corrupt people are often very good at covering their

201
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,700
tracks the uncle

202
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,300
had convinced everyone that he was managing the estate

203
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,166
responsibly

204
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,300
that Mila was too young to handle such wealth

205
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,400
nobody wanted to get involved

206
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,033
especially when the uncle had all the money

207
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:29,333
and all the power

208
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:33,533
with each rejection Nyangtsa Kargyen's heart grew darker

209
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:36,066
then came the final humiliation

210
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,666
one market day after her latest appeal was dismissed

211
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Nyangtsa Kargyen gathered her courage

212
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,000
and confronted her brother in law publicly

213
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:46,366
in front of the entire village

214
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:48,966
she demanded he return what he had stolen

215
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:51,400
you promised my dying husband

216
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,500
she cried you swore to protect his children

217
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:57,366
the uncle's response he laughed

218
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:59,066
actually laughed in her face

219
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,466
then he had her dragged away and thrown into the dirt

220
00:09:01,466 --> 00:09:02,400
like garbage

221
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,666
as Mila watched his mother lying in the dust

222
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,066
his sister crying

223
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,733
and the villagers turning away in embarrassment

224
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:11,700
the boy he had been died

225
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:15,200
his childhood was over his innocence was dead

226
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:18,466
and in its place a terrible anger began to grow

227
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:20,533
that night would change everything

228
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,300
that evening after being humiliated

229
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,566
in front of everyone she had once called friends

230
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,133
Nyangtsa Kargyen sat in the corner of their borrowed hut

231
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:37,133
her hands were dirty her clothes torn

232
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,666
her pride shattered

233
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,566
but her eyes burned with a dangerous desperation

234
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:43,366
she looked at her teenage son

235
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:45,933
this boy who had once been destined for greatness

236
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:48,333
now reduced to rags and shame

237
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:51,866
Mila she said quietly

238
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:55,600
I have tried everything every legal path

239
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,000
every appeal

240
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:59,266
every plea for justice

241
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,366
her voice grew harder with each word

242
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,033
your father's brother has stolen our life

243
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,900
our dignity our future

244
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,966
and the law has abandoned us

245
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:12,266
Mila had never heard his mother speak like this before

246
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:13,466
it frightened him

247
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:18,366
she continued revenge

248
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:20,866
now you have to understand

249
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,000
this wasn't some movie moment

250
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,333
where the hero decides to learn martial arts

251
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:27,966
this was medieval Tibet

252
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,733
when people talked about revenge

253
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,566
they meant darker arts they meant magic

254
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,600
black magic

255
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,066
I want you to learn sorcery his mother said

256
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:39,900
I want you to study the dark arts

257
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:42,066
until you can destroy our enemies completely

258
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,800
little Peta

259
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,833
who had been quietly mending clothes in the corner

260
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,000
gasped mother no

261
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,966
she whispered this isn't who we are

262
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:52,966
father would never want this

263
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:54,666
but Nyangtsa Kargyen

264
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,466
was past caring

265
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,166
what her dead husband would have wanted

266
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,666
if you refuse she said

267
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,666
staring directly into her son's eyes

268
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,533
if you won't avenge your family

269
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,333
then don't call me mother anymore

270
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,700
the ultimatum hit like a physical blow

271
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,666
your mother

272
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:12,666
the person who's supposed to guide you toward goodness

273
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,500
demanding that you become a killer

274
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,400
and if you fail she added

275
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:20,566
if you're too weak to master the magic

276
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:21,866
needed to destroy them

277
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:23,966
I will kill myself

278
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,866
I would rather die than live one more day

279
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,166
in this humiliation

280
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:30,866
Mila felt the world spinning

281
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:33,066
on one side sat his little sister

282
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:35,200
tears streaming down her face

283
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:38,266
silently begging him not to do this terrible thing

284
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,333
on the other side sat his mother

285
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,133
consumed by rage and shame

286
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,200
demanding that he choose between becoming a murderer

287
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:47,300
or losing his family forever

288
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,266
it's impossible to imagine making that choice

289
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:53,400
you're a teenager your family has lost everything

290
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
the legal system has failed you

291
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:58,933
your mother is threatening suicide if you don't act

292
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,600
and deep down aren't you angry too

293
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:03,200
don't you want to see the people

294
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,466
who destroyed your life suffer the way you've suffered

295
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,500
Mila looked at his sister's tears

296
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:11,533
then at his mother's burning eyes

297
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,233
he thought about scrubbing floors in his own home

298
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,166
of eating scraps

299
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,366
while his uncle feasted on stolen wealth

300
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,366
of watching villagers look away

301
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:21,066
when they saw his family's shame

302
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:23,000
the decision tore him apart

303
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,300
but in the end he was still his mother's son

304
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:28,966
I'll do it he whispered

305
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,200
Peta collapsed in sobs

306
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,666
but Nyangtsa Kargyen smiled for the first time in years

307
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:39,333
there's a sorcerer named Yungton Trogyel

308
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,366
she said he's known throughout the region

309
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:43,000
as a master of the dark arts

310
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,133
go to him learn everything he can teach you

311
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,600
she paused and her voice became deadly serious

312
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
and when you return I want our family's enemies to pay

313
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,800
for every day they've made us suffer

314
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:58,766
Mila nodded his childhood was officially over

315
00:12:58,766 --> 00:13:00,566
he was about to become a weapon

316
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,133
so Mila left everything he had ever known

317
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:10,966
and set out to find the most dangerous man in Tibet

318
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:13,366
some say the black arts he would study

319
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:14,566
came not from Buddhism

320
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:17,933
but from Bon Tibet's ancient shamanic tradition

321
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,200
here death wasn't feared it was a power to be summoned

322
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:24,900
when he finally reached Yungton's dwelling

323
00:13:24,966 --> 00:13:26,533
it looked ordinary enough

324
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,300
a simple stone house in a remote valley

325
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,400
but there was an aura of wrongness about the place

326
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:37,133
the air was too still birds didn't sing nearby

327
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,033
Yungton Trogyel was a small

328
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:39,666
quiet man

329
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,733
with eyes that seemed to look right through you

330
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,300
he listened to Mila's story without interruption

331
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:47,733
the stolen inheritance the public humiliation

332
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:49,300
the mother's ultimatum

333
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,500
when Mila finished

334
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:53,900
Yungton was silent for a long moment

335
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,066
you wanna learn sorcery for revenge

336
00:13:57,066 --> 00:14:00,333
he finally said do you understand what that means

337
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,966
Mila nodded though honestly

338
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,966
he had no idea real magic isn't about waving your hands

339
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:08,366
and making things happen

340
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:10,300
real magic is about making bargains

341
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,733
with forces beyond human understanding

342
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:15,566
and those forces always demand payment

343
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,066
Mila asked what kind of payment

344
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:21,000
sometimes your health sometimes your sanity

345
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:21,600
sometimes

346
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,966
pieces of your soul that you'll never get back

347
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,866
Yungton studied this desperate young man

348
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,766
and spoke words that felt ancient

349
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,000
when you deal in curses boy

350
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
know that you must wear them home

351
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,100
but Mila was past caring about the cost

352
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,700
every night he thought about his mother's threat

353
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,266
about his sister's tears

354
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:42,966
about the humiliation that demanded justice

355
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:45,766
so his education in darkness began

356
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:47,833
for months he studied forbidden texts

357
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,166
written in languages that predated Buddhism's arrival

358
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:50,966
in Tibet

359
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,566
he learned to draw protective circles with chalk

360
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:54,566
made from bones

361
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,700
he memorized incantations that made his throat burn

362
00:14:58,366 --> 00:15:01,200
but this wasn't like learning history or poetry

363
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,600
every lesson felt like it was changing his core being

364
00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:07,266
the rituals required him to embrace hatred

365
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:11,100
to nurture anger to feed the darkest parts of his soul

366
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,100
he practiced on small animals

367
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,300
first mice then birds

368
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,600
then larger creatures

369
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:19,566
each death came easier than the last

370
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,733
and slowly terrifyingly

371
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,800
he began to understand how much power he was gaining

372
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,866
the spirits responded to his calls

373
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:31,200
the protective circles

374
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,700
held against forces that could drive men insane

375
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,800
his teacher watched with a mixture of pride and fear

376
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:40,066
finally the night came for the ultimate test

377
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:42,600
Mila stood in the center of a circle

378
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,700
drawn with ash from cremated criminals

379
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,900
around him were symbols that hurt to look at directly

380
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:48,866
in his hands

381
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:51,466
was a ritual dagger that seemed to absorb light

382
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:55,133
for hours he chanted incantations in the ancient tongue

383
00:15:55,466 --> 00:15:56,666
he called upon spirits

384
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,700
whose names cannot be spoken in daylight

385
00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:01,000
he offered pieces of his own life force

386
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,200
as payment for what he was about to unleash

387
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,100
and then an entity answered

388
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,500
the air became thick as water

389
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,166
shadows moved independently of their sources

390
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,066
and Mila felt a presence so alien and hungry

391
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,566
that every instinct screamed at him to run

392
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:18,600
but he didn't run instead

393
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,200
he made his bargain with darkness

394
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:22,333
when the ritual ended

395
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,866
Yungton looked at his student with genuine fear

396
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,900
you now possess the power to summon death itself

397
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:33,100
he whispered but remember the forces you now command

398
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,600
don't distinguish between guilty and innocent

399
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,266
once you unleash them

400
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:39,466
they will devour everything in their path

401
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,533
Mila gathered his few possessions

402
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:44,600
and began the journey back to his village

403
00:16:45,066 --> 00:16:48,100
he was no longer the broken boy who had left months ago

404
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:50,800
he was a weapon and he was going home

405
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:58,400
when Mila returned to his village after months away

406
00:16:58,633 --> 00:17:00,600
nobody recognized him at first

407
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:02,466
the magic had changed him

408
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,100
his eyes were colder his face was thinner

409
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:07,000
his skin had a greyish pallor

410
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,166
and there was an aura about his presence

411
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,466
that made people instinctively step away

412
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,733
even little Peta when she first saw him whispered

413
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:17,600
brother what have they done to you

414
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:20,066
but he wasn't there for reunions

415
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,533
he was there to complete a promise

416
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,500
and fate or maybe darker forces

417
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:27,600
had given him the perfect opportunity

418
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:30,400
his uncle's son was getting married

419
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,166
the entire

420
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:34,066
extended family had gathered for a massive Celebration

421
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,666
35 people crowded into the house

422
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,666
that had once belonged to Mila's father

423
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,933
eating food bought with stolen money

424
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,300
celebrating with wine purchased through stolen wealth

425
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,200
the uncle and aunt had no

426
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,566
idea that death was watching them

427
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,500
from the shadows

428
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,166
Mila found a secluded spot on the Hillside

429
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,033
overlooking the house he could hear their laughter

430
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:55,933
their songs their joy

431
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:59,166
for a moment he hesitated

432
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,666
these weren't all evil people

433
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:04,566
some were relatives who had come for a wedding

434
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,933
children who had done nothing wrong

435
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:09,533
young couples starting their lives together

436
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,300
but then he remembered his mother's ultimatum

437
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,533
the public humiliation the stolen inheritance

438
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,266
the promise he had made

439
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:20,366
and any mercy he might have felt died

440
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,300
he began the ritual first

441
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,000
he drew the protective circle with ash

442
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,800
he had carried from Yungton's lair

443
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:30,100
then he placed the cursed objects at specific points

444
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:33,266
each one consecrated with blood and hatred

445
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,566
as the sun set behind the mountains

446
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:36,733
he began to chant

447
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,800
the words that came from his mouth

448
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,966
weren't human language

449
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,366
they were sounds that predated civilization

450
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,666
syllables that existed in the spaces between nightmares

451
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,533
with each verse the air around him grew thicker

452
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,500
darker

453
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,500
and then

454
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,866
he called upon the entity he had bargained with

455
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,400
I offer you this feast

456
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
he whispered in the ancient tongue

457
00:18:58,366 --> 00:19:01,400
35 souls in exchange for the justice

458
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,966
that was denied to my family

459
00:19:04,366 --> 00:19:06,666
for a moment nothing happened

460
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,766
then the temperature dropped 20 degrees in seconds

461
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:14,400
inside the house the Celebration suddenly went quiet

462
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:16,966
someone screamed that the walls were moving

463
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:19,766
others pointed at shadows crawling across the ceiling

464
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:22,866
like living things but that was only the beginning

465
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,300
Mila raised his ritual dagger toward the sky

466
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,500
and spoke the final words of the spell

467
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,066
what happened next defied every law of nature

468
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,933
the clear evening sky suddenly boiled with black clouds

469
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,066
wind that hadn't existed moments before began howling

470
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:40,400
and from those impossible clouds came hail

471
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,066
but this wasn't ordinary hail

472
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:44,933
these were massive chunks of ice

473
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:46,600
the size of human skulls

474
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:49,000
each one fell with impossible force

475
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,166
guided by supernatural hatred

476
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,066
the first hailstone smashed through the roof

477
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:55,266
like it was made of paper

478
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,600
the second crushed a supporting beam

479
00:19:57,766 --> 00:20:01,566
the third and fourth and dozens more

480
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,166
began systematically destroying the house

481
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,300
the sound was indescribable

482
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,766
cracking wood screaming wind

483
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,100
human voices raised in terror

484
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:12,633
inside

485
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:15,966
35 people who had been celebrating moments before

486
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:17,800
were now trapped in a nightmare

487
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,066
some tried to run others hid under tables

488
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:25,133
nothing mattered the supernatural storm was methodical

489
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,600
relentless and standing in his ritual circle

490
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:31,300
Mila watched it all with cold satisfaction

491
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,100
this was justice

492
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,300
this was what his family's enemies deserved

493
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:39,366
the storm lasted exactly as long as the ritual required

494
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,800
when Mila spoke the final word

495
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:45,300
the wind stopped the clouds vanished

496
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:49,466
the hail ceased falling and in the sudden silence

497
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:51,666
nothing moved in what had once been a house

498
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,366
35 people gone

499
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,266
only two figures emerged from the wreckage

500
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,166
his uncle and aunt somehow

501
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,933
spared by forces that Mila would never understand

502
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:06,666
perhaps the spirits wanted them to live with the loss

503
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:07,866
perhaps

504
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,200
their suffering was more valuable than their deaths

505
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,966
the uncle and aunt staggered through the ruins

506
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,566
calling out names of family members

507
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:15,733
who would never answer

508
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:18,000
some say it was supernatural

509
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,666
others believe a natural storm

510
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,500
struck at the worst possible moment

511
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:25,766
but what matters is this in the hearts of villagers

512
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:30,000
it became a curse and Milarepa its architect

513
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,266
but as Mila stood there watching his uncle

514
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:35,000
and aunt weep over the destruction

515
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:39,133
he felt no satisfaction he felt empty

516
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,533
when he returned to their small hut

517
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,800
his mother was waiting

518
00:21:44,466 --> 00:21:48,100
did you do it she asked he nodded

519
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:52,200
for three days she reveled in their enemy's destruction

520
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,966
but then she saw a young woman

521
00:21:53,966 --> 00:21:56,700
weeping over the ruins where her new husband had died

522
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:57,800
a husband

523
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,866
whose only crime was being related to the wrong family

524
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,066
that's when the reality hit her

525
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:04,666
they hadn't punished the guilty

526
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,200
they had slaughtered innocence

527
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:12,800
the days after the massacre

528
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,866
were the longest of Mila's life

529
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,366
he had expected to feel victorious

530
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,466
satisfied complete

531
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:22,866
instead he felt hollow

532
00:22:23,266 --> 00:22:25,300
like his essential self had been carved out

533
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,800
and could never be replaced

534
00:22:27,266 --> 00:22:28,766
the village was in mourning

535
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:32,066
35 families had lost loved ones in a single night

536
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:35,000
children cried for parents who would never come home

537
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,666
parents wept over children

538
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,566
who had died for someone else's crimes

539
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,733
and Mila the architect of all this suffering

540
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:43,866
found that revenge tasted like ashes

541
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,066
one evening as Mila sat staring at nothing

542
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,300
his little sister Peta approached him

543
00:22:50,366 --> 00:22:53,866
her eyes were red from crying not for the dead

544
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,333
but for what her brother had become

545
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:00,100
what have you become she whispered

546
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:02,600
the question hit him like a physical blow

547
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,200
what had he become he had started as a victim

548
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,633
a boy

549
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:09,366
whose family had been destroyed by greed and cruelty

550
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,766
someone deserving of sympathy and justice

551
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:14,566
but somewhere along the path of revenge

552
00:23:14,966 --> 00:23:17,133
he had transformed into a destroyer

553
00:23:17,966 --> 00:23:20,333
a killer a destroyer of families

554
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,300
someone who had caused more suffering

555
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,433
than had ever been inflicted

556
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:25,566
on him that night

557
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,633
alone in the darkness Mila

558
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:28,600
finally allowed himself

559
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,700
to feel the full weight of what he had done

560
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:34,700
35 people gone forever because of him

561
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,600
families destroyed because of his magic

562
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,266
a community traumatized

563
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:41,066
because of his thirst for vengeance

564
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,666
in Buddhism karma isn't moral accounting

565
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:45,866
it's momentum

566
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,866
and Mila's momentum was now deadly

567
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,100
rolling fast toward an even darker fate

568
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,166
he thought destroying the house would bring peace

569
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,800
but he had been chasing illusions

570
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,166
shadows that only deepened his pain

571
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:00,466
as Mila stood

572
00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:02,566
in the ruins of what his anger had created

573
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:04,633
as he felt the weight of 35 deaths

574
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:06,100
crushing down on his soul

575
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,633
he looked up at the stars

576
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:08,466
and whispered words

577
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:10,333
that would later echo in his teachings

578
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,066
in the sky of mind the storm clouds gather

579
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,933
but beyond them the moon still shines

580
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:18,933
he paused

581
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,366
and asked the question that would change everything

582
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:25,300
can someone who has fallen this far into darkness

583
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,200
ever find their way back to the light

584
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,500
unknown to Mila his question had already been heard

585
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:35,133
in the distance a figure watched from the mountain path

586
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:37,600
an old monk with kind eyes

587
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:40,200
who had been traveling these valleys for many years

588
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,300
searching for students

589
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,400
ready to learn the hardest lessons of all

590
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,200
the monk had witnessed the supernatural storm

591
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,600
had seen the destruction

592
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:49,600
had felt the young man's anguish

593
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,133
rippling through the spiritual realm like waves

594
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,300
most teachers would have turned away from such darkness

595
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,300
but this monk understood a truth that few others did

596
00:24:58,766 --> 00:24:59,900
that sometimes

597
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,566
the deepest enlightenment comes from the deepest fall

598
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,200
his name was Marpa and he had been waiting for someone

599
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,800
exactly like Milarepa

600
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:11,200
the path to redemption was about to begin

601
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,600
can someone who has committed terrible acts

602
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,733
ever find redemption can a killer become a saint

603
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,366
that's the question we'll explore in Part 2

604
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:26,966
when Mila

605
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:29,533
meets the most demanding teacher in Buddhist history

606
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:32,566
a master who will break him down completely

607
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:35,133
before building him into something extraordinary

608
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:36,900
but I want to know

609
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,333
have you ever done something you deeply regret

610
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:42,366
something that made you question who you really are

611
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,000
leave a comment below

612
00:25:44,766 --> 00:25:47,166
sometimes the path to healing starts with admitting

613
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:47,966
we need it

614
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,400
if Milarepa's story resonates with you

615
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,366
if you believe that redemption is possible

616
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:55,866
even for the worst among us

617
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:59,266
then subscribe and stay with us on this path

618
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,366
because the light is coming

619
00:26:01,366 --> 00:26:03,133
but not before more darkness
