1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,033
what if I told you that according to Buddha

2
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:12,733
you achieved enlightenment the moment you were born

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,266
I know what you're thinking

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,500
Peter that's impossible

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,700
I can barely get through Monday mornings

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,200
without caffeine let alone claim I'm enlightened

7
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:27,100
over the past months

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,466
as we've explored different Buddhist teachings

9
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:31,500
Buddha nature keeps appearing

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,800
and your comments have been piling up

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,000
if I'm already enlightened

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,800
why do I meditate every morning

13
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:43,966
this makes no sense I still get angry at traffic

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,633
are you saying

15
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:48,400
all my spiritual seeking has been pointless

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,566
these are the exact same paradoxes

17
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:53,766
that have captivated Buddhist scholars

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,500
challenged meditation masters

19
00:00:56,966 --> 00:01:00,000
and sparked profound discussions for centuries

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,600
because Buddha said something far more radical

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,033
than we might expect something

22
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,200
that completely flips

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,233
our understanding of the spiritual path

24
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:10,200
on its head

25
00:01:11,366 --> 00:01:13,366
today we're finally giving Buddha

26
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:15,300
nature the deep dive it deserves

27
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,466
welcome back to Buddha's wisdom

28
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:18,700
I'm Peter and Buddha

29
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,600
Nature has been the elephant in the room

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,900
on this channel we've mentioned it dozens of times

31
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,933
referenced it in our videos on Buddhist schools

32
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:29,766
brought it up when discussing enlightenment

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
alluded to it when exploring consciousness itself

34
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:38,600
Buddha nature or Tathāgatagarbha in Sanskrit

35
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,433
represents

36
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,533
one of Buddhism's most transformative concepts

37
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,066
this teaching shakes up everything you think you are

38
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,100
and completely reframes what spiritual practice

39
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,166
accomplishes

40
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,266
the Tathāgatagarbha Sutra puts it directly

41
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,200
think about that for a moment

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,266
Buddha wasn't saying you can become enlightened

43
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:08,633
if you try hard enough he was declaring

44
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:11,666
you are enlightened right now

45
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,766
as you listen to these words

46
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:17,633
different schools have wrestled with this teaching

47
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:20,966
for over 2,000 years some embrace it completely

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,266
others approach it with caution

49
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:27,233
the reasons why reveal something profound

50
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:29,466
about the nature of awakening itself

51
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,166
so today we'll explore what Buddha actually taught

52
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,566
why this created fascinating debates

53
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:38,666
and most importantly

54
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,900
how recognizing your Buddha nature

55
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:44,800
changes everything about your spiritual life

56
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,833
because by the end you'll understand why

57
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,500
the real question becomes

58
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,600
how do I recognize what I already am

59
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:01,366
the story begins with one of Buddhism's most beautiful

60
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:02,166
metaphors

61
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:05,766
Buddha described our true nature like a precious jewel

62
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:09,700
wrapped in dirty cloth buried in garbage

63
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:13,666
the jewel itself remains absolutely perfect untarnished

64
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,500
radiant the dirt around it doesn't change

65
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,166
the jewel's essential nature

66
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,900
it covers the brilliance

67
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,566
but cannot damage what lies beneath

68
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:26,533
this comes from the Tathāgatagarbha Sutra

69
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:29,366
where Buddha revealed something that would reshape

70
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:31,166
Buddhist understanding forever

71
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:33,566
he taught that every sentient being possesses

72
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:35,800
what he called Tathāgatagarbha

73
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:40,366
the womb of the Buddha or Buddha embryo

74
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,333
this isn't potential for enlightenment

75
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:46,166
this is enlightenment itself

76
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,066
present and complete

77
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:50,700
waiting to be recognized

78
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:52,600
Buddha explained

79
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,400
that this nature has three remarkable qualities

80
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,266
first it's completely pure

81
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:00,866
no amount of negative karma

82
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:04,466
no years of bad habits can actually stain it

83
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,933
second it's unchanging

84
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,466
while your thoughts and emotions fluctuate constantly

85
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:14,300
this essence remains perfectly stable

86
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,766
third it's blissful

87
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:17,600
by nature

88
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:20,066
meaning your deepest core

89
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:22,300
radiates peace and contentment

90
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,700
the Nirvana Sutra adds another dimension

91
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,500
Buddha nature is the self hidden by defilements

92
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,066
revealed by practice

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,600
now you might wonder Peter

94
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,166
if this is true why don't I feel enlightened

95
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,500
Buddha's answer reveals his most revolutionary insight

96
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,366
we experience suffering not because we lack something

97
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:46,100
but because we don't recognize what we already possess

98
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,100
you're like a lion raised by sheep

99
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:50,933
who believes he's a sheep

100
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:54,100
think about what this means

101
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,566
every moment you spend feeling inadequate

102
00:04:56,766 --> 00:04:58,866
every time you think you need fixing

103
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:02,366
every instance you believe you're fundamentally flawed

104
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:05,666
you're experiencing mistaken identity

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,066
and when this teaching hit the Buddhist world

106
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:09,200
it ignited debates

107
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,366
that nearly split the tradition apart

108
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,233
picture this Buddhist masters

109
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:20,733
who devoted their lives to the same teachings

110
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,266
suddenly facing off

111
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:25,133
in debates that would reshape Buddhism forever

112
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:26,666
when Buddha

113
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,166
nature teachings spread through the Buddhist world

114
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:32,366
it created divisions that echo to this day

115
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,700
the Theravāda tradition approached it cautiously

116
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,700
they acknowledged the concept

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,766
but emphasized potential rather than actuality

118
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,333
for them you have the seed of enlightenment

119
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,633
but it requires cultivation through practice

120
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:49,733
to manifest

121
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,266
their logic made sense

122
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:55,200
if everyone already possessed full enlightenment

123
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,400
why would Buddha spend 45 years teaching

124
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,733
why establish monasteries

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,066
why create detailed meditation instructions

126
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,233
the Mahāyāna schools embraced Buddha nature

127
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:11,100
wholeheartedly they saw it as foundational to their

128
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,400
entire understanding

129
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,433
the Yogācāra schools spoke of Buddha nature

130
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:16,866
unfolding in layers

131
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:19,200
like a lotus opening petal

132
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,000
by petal

133
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,866
the Zen tradition took this furthest

134
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:24,766
they built their entire practice around

135
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:26,800
directly pointing to Buddha nature

136
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:30,200
The 13th century master Dogen taught

137
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:37,566
Master Huangbo put it even more directly

138
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:39,766
Master Huangbo put it even more directly

139
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:45,733
but here's where the story gets dramatic

140
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,033
a monk once asked his master

141
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,900
how do I see my Buddha nature

142
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,566
the master replied

143
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,200
have you heard the sound of the mountain stream

144
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,466
the monk paused to listen

145
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,666
in that moment of pure awareness

146
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,600
Enlightenment struck like lightning

147
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,866
the Tibetan

148
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:05,266
schools wove together different perspectives

149
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:08,033
creating intricate visions of how Buddha nature

150
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:09,000
manifests

151
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,833
each school shaped their meditation

152
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,766
around how they saw Buddha nature

153
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,033
these debates weren't academic

154
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:19,266
they shaped how millions practiced and still do today

155
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:21,566
some worried that emphasizing

156
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,633
inherent enlightenment

157
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:24,900
might lead to spiritual complacency

158
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:27,600
others argued that recognizing

159
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,633
Buddha nature provides the confidence

160
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:32,000
necessary for authentic development

161
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:35,866
whether you emphasize potential or actuality

162
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:38,733
whether you focus on gradual development

163
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,333
or sudden recognition

164
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:43,733
all traditions agree on one crucial point

165
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,633
understanding Buddha nature

166
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:48,500
transforms how you relate to your spiritual path

167
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:50,633
which brings us to the question

168
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:52,333
that's been driving your comments

169
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,300
here's the question that's been flooding our comments

170
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,433
the same one that stopped me in my tracks

171
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:04,700
when I first encountered this teaching

172
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:07,033
if you're already enlightened

173
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:10,000
why meditate if your nature is already perfect

174
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:11,400
why work on yourself

175
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,633
a Zen master

176
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:16,266
once described two approaches to cleaning a mirror

177
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:17,600
the first says

178
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,866
the mirror is dirty

179
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:24,266
I must polish it until it becomes clean

180
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,333
the second says

181
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,733
the mirror is already perfectly reflective

182
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,566
I need to remove the dust obscuring its natural clarity

183
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,433
both involve the same action

184
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,500
wiping the mirror

185
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,366
but the understanding behind the action

186
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:41,366
completely changes the experience

187
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,666
when you meditate

188
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,633
believing you need to become enlightened

189
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:47,500
every moment of distraction feels like failure

190
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,266
every arising thought

191
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:52,066
becomes evidence of spiritual inadequacy

192
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:53,866
but when you meditate

193
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,066
knowing your nature is already whole

194
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,966
distraction becomes information

195
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,000
you're not trying to achieve a special state

196
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,766
you're recognizing the awareness that's already present

197
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,833
meditation doesn't become lazy

198
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,233
recognizing your Buddha

199
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:12,600
nature takes real skill and attention

200
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,233
it's like learning to see the sky

201
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,466
instead of getting lost in clouds

202
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,466
the sky is always there

203
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:23,266
but recognizing it takes practice

204
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:26,500
every time you notice you've been lost in thought

205
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,266
and return to awareness you're not fixing a mistake

206
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,800
you're exercising

207
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,733
the capacity to recognize your true nature

208
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,166
here's the beautiful paradox

209
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
the harder you chase enlightenment

210
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,800
the further it runs but the moment you stop

211
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:47,666
there it is sitting quietly sipping tea

212
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,200
this is the moment when seeking

213
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,400
stop and finding begins

214
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,800
when the Buddha you thought was out there

215
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:59,166
reveals itself as the very awareness looking for Buddha

216
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,800
this understanding transforms everything

217
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,600
when you recognize your own inherent wholeness

218
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:08,700
you begin seeing it in others

219
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,500
too

220
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:12,366
that person who cut you off in traffic

221
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,300
they have Buddha Nature

222
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:16,666
your annoying coworker

223
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:18,766
Buddha Nature

224
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,566
this doesn't mean you become a doormat

225
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:23,866
it means you can respond to situations

226
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:27,000
without taking them as personal attacks on your worth

227
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,100
imagine

228
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,833
chasing goals without that tight knot in your chest

229
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,000
no fear of failing no need to prove anything

230
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,466
success doesn't diminish

231
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:38,733
or enhance your essential nature

232
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:41,566
that's the freedom we're talking about

233
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,500
this understanding changes your relationship with time

234
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,200
itself you stop living in some imagined future

235
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,066
when you'll finally be enough

236
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,333
the present moment becomes sufficient

237
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,733
because your Buddha nature

238
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,900
exists only in the present moment

239
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:00,700
this isn't the laziness of giving up

240
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,600
it's the deep exhale of finally coming home to yourself

241
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:06,866
but even as we explore these implications

242
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,033
there remains something that must be tasted

243
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:10,500
rather than described

244
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,133
experienced rather than understood

245
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:20,166
after exploring the teachings

246
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,533
the debates as the practical implications

247
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:25,100
there remains something about Buddha nature

248
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,766
that words cannot capture

249
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:30,000
modern neuroscientists

250
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,866
like Doctor Judson Brewer at Harvard

251
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:33,700
study pure awareness

252
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:35,900
the baseline state of consciousness

253
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,366
that remains present during meditation

254
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:42,100
during sleep even during anesthesia

255
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,800
some are beginning to wonder

256
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:47,700
maybe awareness isn't part of the mind

257
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:50,400
it might be what everything else rests on

258
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:53,233
but even sophisticated brain imaging cannot

259
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:56,333
capture what Buddha nature actually feels like

260
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,566
when recognized directly

261
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,700
this is why authentic

262
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,300
spiritual traditions emphasize experience

263
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,733
over explanation

264
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,900
Buddha used the metaphor of a finger

265
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,066
pointing at the moon

266
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:11,533
the finger helps you locate the moon

267
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,300
but you must see the moon with your own eyes

268
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,766
pause for a moment feel the awareness

269
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:20,633
noticing these words that's it

270
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:23,400
closer than breath unchanging

271
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:25,500
always present

272
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:27,900
your Buddha nature exists

273
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,466
more intimately than your thoughts

274
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:31,266
more present than your emotions

275
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:34,600
yet it remains completely transparent

276
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,900
the more you search for your Buddha nature

277
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,533
the more it seems to recede

278
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,900
yet the moment you stop searching

279
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,866
you realize it was never actually hidden

280
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,000
can you find the awareness

281
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,533
that's aware of your thoughts

282
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:51,900
without becoming another thought

283
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,100
can you recognize the you that observes experience

284
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:59,800
without turning that recognition

285
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,333
into another experience to grasp

286
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:06,066
these questions point towards something that cannot

287
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:10,566
be answered with words they can only be lived explored

288
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:13,100
recognized directly

289
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,900
the awareness reading these words right now

290
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,033
what

291
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:19,966
if it's the Buddha you've been searching for all along

292
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,266
maybe the real mystery isn't finding Buddha nature

293
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:25,400
it's realizing it never left

294
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,233
what have you noticed about the awareness

295
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:32,966
that's been present throughout this entire video

296
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
share your insights in the comments

297
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:38,733
what questions does this raise about your own practice

298
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:41,800
if this exploration

299
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,000
sparked your curiosity about consciousness

300
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,400
