his son from experiencing any kind of

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,320
suffering so he basically bubble wrapped

25
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,320
the prince's life with every luxury

26
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,320

death but at the ripe old age of 29

29
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,320
sidartha decided it was time to pop that

30
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,119
bubble and see what the real world had

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,920
to

outside the palace sidartha had a front

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,560
row seat to the harsh truths of Life

36
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,680
known as the four sights first he met an

37
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,039
elderly man bent with age then he saw a

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,439
sick person their body ravaged by

39
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:09,759
disease next he stumbled Upon A corpse a

40
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,440
blunt reminder of life's

41
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,000
impermanence finally he encountered an

42
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,800
aesthetic a Wandering holy man who had

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,720
renounced worldly possessions in search

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,560
of spiritual truth as the Buddha later

45
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,080
reflected the root of suffering is

46
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,640
attachment these experiences hit

47
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,080
sidartha like a ton of karma shattering

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,200
his Rose tinted glasses and setting him

49
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,760
on a quest to find a way out of

50
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,800
suffering faced with these hard truths

51
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,360
sidartha made a decision that would make

52
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,840
even the most adventurous of us think

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,040
twice at 29 he left behind his plush

54
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,599
Palace his gorgeous wife and his

55
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,239
adorable baby boy to become a Wandering

56
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,360
Monk on a mission to unlock the secrets

57
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:55,319
of the universe talk about a midlife

58
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,080
crisis for the next 6 years sidartha

59
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:00,080
threw himself into the world of extreme

60
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,599
asceticism he sought out the most

61
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,519
renowned spiritual teachers of his time

62
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:08,080
hoping to find the key to

63
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,840
Liberation first he studied with Alara k

64
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,200
a master of meditation who taught him

65
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,640
how to reach deep states of

66
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,879
concentration known as the sphere of

67
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,200
nothingness but even in these profound

68
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:21,080
meditative States sidartha realized that

69
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,440
true freedom from suffering eluded him

70
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,000
next he apprenticed with udaka raputa

71
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,360
who guided him to an even more refined

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,319
level of meditation called the sphere of

73
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,360
neither perception nor nonp

74
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,599
perception this was a state of such

75
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,000
subtlety that it was hard to even

76
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,400
describe yet despite mastering these

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,200
Advanced Techniques sidartha still felt

78
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,480
a gnawing sense that he had not reached

79
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,159
the end of the

80
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,040
path frustrated but determined sidhartha

81
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,360
left these teachers and set out on his

82
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,720
own pushing himself to the brink of

83
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,439
starvation and subjecting himself to

84
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,840
intense physical hardships as he would

85
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,720
later teach to enjoy good health to

86
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,239
bring true happiness to one's family to

87
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:08,439
bring peace to all one must first

88
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:11,599
discipline and control one's own

89
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:14,200
mind at his lowest point sidhartha was a

90
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,280
mere shadow of his former self he had

91
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,840
pushed himself to the very edge of human

92
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,680
endurance but still the answers he

93
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,160
sought eluded him it was in this moment

94
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,880
of utter desolation that a memory from

95
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,759
his childhood surfaced a memory of

96
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,440
naturally falling into a state of deep

97
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:32,320
meditation

98
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,880
as he recalled the peace and Clarity he

99
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,720
had experienced a profound realization

100
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,639
dawned on him the path to Enlightenment

101
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,320
was not to be found in the extremes of

102
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,960
indulgence or deprivation but in the

103
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,560
middle way a balanced approach that

104
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,000
avoided both excess and

105
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,080
asceticism with this understanding

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,199
sidartha mustered his last ounce of

107
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,759
strength and set out to find a quiet

108
00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:01,000
place to meditate determined to give his

109
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:03,520
Quest For Truth one final chance

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,680
for 49 days and nights sidartha sat

111
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,520
beneath the bod tree locked in an

112
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,039
intense Battle of the mind he faced down

113
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,560
Mara the demon of Illusion and desire

114
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,560
and met each of his attacks with the

115
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,880
shield of mindfulness and the sword of

116
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,600
wisdom on the 49th day as the morning

117
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,360
star appeared in the sky sidartha

118
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,240
finally attained complete and perfect

119
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,600
Enlightenment becoming the Buddha the

120
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,639

121
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,080
the shackles of suffering his heart

122
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:39,639
filled with boundless compassion for all

123
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:42,600
beings and that my friends was just the

124
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,280
beginning for the next 45 years the

125
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,240
Buddha traveled far and wide sharing his

126
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,560
teachings on the path to Liberation with

127
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,039
anyone who would listen he taught the

128
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,800
four noble truths the essence of his

129
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:57,080
wisdom that life is suffering that

130
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,479
suffering arises from attachment that

131
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,840
it's possible to end suffering and that

132
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:03,440
the the path to Freedom is the

133
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:08,520
eight-fold path of right understanding

134
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,599
thought speech action livelihood effort

135
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,599
mindfulness and

136
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:14,880
concentration he championed the

137
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:17,479
middleway encouraging his followers to

138
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,120
find balance and avoid extremes and he

139
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:22,680
created a community of monks and nuns

140
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,520
the S to carry on his teachings after he

141
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,319
was

142
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,960
gone as the Buddha famously said

143
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,800
thousands of candles can be lighted from

144
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,319
a single candle and the life of the

145
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,520
candle will not be shortened happiness

146
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,520
never decreases by being

147
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,720
shared now you might be thinking wait a

148
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,680
minute Matt was sidartha Gama the only

149
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,960
Buddha great

150
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,960
question the short answer is no but the

151
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,759
full story is a bit more complex you see

152
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,360
the word Buddha means awakened one and

153
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,560
it refers to anyone who has attained

154
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,479
full Enlightenment and broken free from

155
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,199
the cycle of rebirth

156
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,440
Buddhist scriptures tell us that there

157
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,120
have been many Buddhas in the past and

158
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,000
that there will be many more in the

159
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,160
future in fact Buddhists believe that a

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,879
future Buddha named mraa will appear

161
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,560
when sidartha Gama's teachings have

162
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,280
faded from memory and in Mahayana

163
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,240
Buddhism there's even a whole path

164
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,960
dedicated to becoming a Buddha called

165
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,800

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,639

lives of countless people over the

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,960
day countless eons from now you and I

190
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,960
might just become Buddhas

191
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,479
ourselves you know folks learning about

192
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,280
the Buddha's life and teachings has had

193
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,919
a profound impact on my own Journey

194
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,280
there was a time in my life when I felt

195
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:33,599
like I was stuck in a rut chasing after

196
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,240
one fleeting pleasure after another but

197
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,719
never feeling truly fulfilled it was

198
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,599
like I was on a hamster wheel of stress

199
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,519
and dissatisfaction and I didn't know

200
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,240
how to get off but then I stumbled upon

201
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,000
the Buddha's story and it was like a

202
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,320
light bulb went off in my head his

203
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,800
message of finding balance letting go of

204
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,440
attachments and cultivating mindfulness

205
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,480
resonated with me on a deep level I

206
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,839
started incorporating meditation into my

207
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,720
daily routine and slowly but surely I

208
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,680
began to feel a shift in my

209
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,360
perspective instead of constantly

210
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,279
grasping for more I learned to

211
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,560
appreciate the simple joys in life I

212
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,200
became more present in my relationships

213
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,000
more compassionate towards myself and

214
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,120
others and more resilient in the face of

215
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,959
challenges and while I'm still a work in

216
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,600
progress I can honestly say that the

217
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:25,000
Buddha's teachings have helped me find a

218
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,000
greater sense of Peace purpose and

219
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,279
happiness in fact this channel Buddha's

220
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,839
wisdom was was born out of my own

221
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,240
transformative experience with the

222
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,399
Buddha's

223
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,600
teachings my good friend Peter and I

224
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,880
both felt so inspired by the Dharma that

225
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,120
we wanted to share it with as many

226
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,560

227
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,720

231
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,959
