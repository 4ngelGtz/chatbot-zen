thought to another do you find it hard

10
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,439

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,120
sitting in silence and trying not to

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,840
think about anything boy was I wrong

self-awareness and

let's get into the juicy part the simple

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,040
method here's how it

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,640
works step one find a comfortable

62
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,360
position you can sit cross-legged in a

63
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,840
chair or even lie down just make sure

64
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,560
you're relaxed and won't be disturbed if

65
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,560
you want you can set a timer for 5 to

66
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,840
10es minutes so you don't have to worry

67
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,879
about checking the

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,560
clock step two focus on your breath

69
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,480
close your eyes and start noticing the

70
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,000
sensation of the air moving in and out

71
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,360
of your nose don't try to control your

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,840
breath just let it flow

73
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,040
naturally if it helps you can imagine

74
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,000
the air as a gentle wave moving in and

75
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,800
out with each inhale and

76
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,599
exhale step three acknowledge thoughts

77
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,959
and let them pass as you meditate

78
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,000
thoughts will pop up in your mind mind

79
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,319
that's totally normal don't get

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,519
frustrated or try to push them away

81
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,159
instead simply acknowledge them and

82
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,680
gently redirect your focus back to your

83
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:16,040
breath think of your thoughts as clouds

84
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:19,720
drifting across the sky they come and go

85
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:23,040
but the sky Remains the

86
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,159
Same step four return to the

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,120
breath whenever you find your mind

88
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:30,400
wandering and trust me it will just come

89
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,920
back to the sensation of breathing it's

90
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,200
like a little game of find the

91
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,680
breath each time you notice your mind

92
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,280
has drifted silently say thinking and

93
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,560
then refocus on your breath don't judge

94
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,840
yourself or get discouraged this is all

95
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,400
part of the

96
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,200
process step five practice regularly

97
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,480
like any skill meditation gets better

98
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,079
with practice try to set aside a few

99
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,760
minutes each day to meditate and

100
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,040
gradually increase the time as you get

101
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,720
more comfortable you can start with just

102
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,920
5 minutes a day and work your way up to

103
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,000
longer sessions the key is to be

104
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,439
consistent and make meditation a part of

105
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,640
your daily routine now I know what

106
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,840
you're thinking that sounds great Matt

107
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,720
but what if I get distracted or can't

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,920
sit still don't worry everyone faces

109
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,040
challenges when they start meditating

110
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,440
the key is to be kind to yourself and

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,639
remember that it's all part of the

112
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,280
process if you find yourself getting

113
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,040
distracted simply notice the distraction

114
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,759
and gently bring your attention back to

115
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,960
your breath it's like training a puppy

116
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,120
you need to be patient and keep guiding

117
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,120
it back to where you want it to be and

118
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,160
if you're feeling restless try taking a

119
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,479
few deep breaths or even doing a quick

120
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,600
stretch before settling back into your

121
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,560
meditation another common challenge is

122
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,639
dealing with self-doubt you might find

123
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,639
yourself thinking I'm not doing this

124
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,880
right or I'm not good at meditating but

125
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,560
here's the thing there's no such thing

126
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,280
as a perfect meditation everyone's

127
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,560
experience is different and the goal

128
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,320
isn't to clear your mind completely but

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,639
rather to notice when it wanders and

130
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,840
gently bring it back so if self-doubt

131
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,520
starts creeping in just remember that

132
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,039
everyone starts somewhere you don't have

133
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,520
to be perfect to benefit from meditation

134
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,160
you just have to show up and give it

135
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,160
your best shot and if you find yourself

136
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,800
struggling don't hesitate to reach out

137
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,800
to the Buddha's wisdom Community for

138
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,000

calmer and more centered throughout the

day or perhaps you'll have an easier

146
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,720
time focusing on tasks and making

147
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,840
decisions you might even start to feel

148
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,199
more connected to the world around you

149
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,280
and more appreciative of the little

150
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,560
