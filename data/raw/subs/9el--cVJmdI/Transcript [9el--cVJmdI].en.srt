it Deckard played by Harrison Ford in

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,399

Noir tackles questions that have

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,280
intrigued Buddhist thinkers for

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,080
Millennia what defines

31
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,119
humanity is our sense of self Just an

32
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,240
Illusion can artificial beings achieve

33
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,560
enlightenment from replicants yearning

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,360
for more life to a detective questioning

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,479
his very existence Blade Runner offers a

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,000
unique lens to examine core Buddhist

37
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,079
Concepts like impermanence attachment

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,280
and Consciousness and let's face it

39
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,240
folks with AI making headlines every day

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,320
Blade Runners questions about artificial

41
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,640
life and what it means to be human

42
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,320
aren't just sci-fi anymore they're

43
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,520
becoming our

44
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,759
reality who knew that a movie from 1982

45
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,240
would be more relevant now than ever

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,640
it's like Ridley Scott had a crystal

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,079
ball or maybe just really good intuition

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,520
about our robot filled

49
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,360
future the film's exploration of these

50
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,719
themes has left an able mark on popular

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,960
culture influencing everything from

52
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,160
cyberpunk Aesthetics to Serious

53
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,560
discussions about AI ethics and the

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,640
nature of

55
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,680
Consciousness so power up your Spinners

56
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,720
and adjust your Voit Camp machines we're

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,480
about to uncover the hidden Dharma

58
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,680
within this culturally significant

59
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,280
Masterpiece and don't worry if you can't

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,239
tell a replicant from a human by the end

61
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,720
of this video you might not be sure if

62
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,720
you're one either

63
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,080
before we explore Buddhist philosophy

64
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,599
let's set the stage for those who

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,920
haven't yet experienced Ridley Scott's

66
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,680
Masterpiece Blade Runner transports us

67
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,120

Earth's Elite have fled to offworld

70
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:52,319
colonies leaving the planet's drgs

71
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:55,319
behind enter replicants bioengineered

72
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,800
beings virtually identical to humans

73
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:01,000
created for dangerous or menial work in

74
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,720
these colonies they fast faster stronger

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,200
and potentially smarter than their

76
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,360
creators but with a crucial

77
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,120
limitation a 4-year

78
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,680
lifespan our story follows Rick Deckard

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,560
a reluctant Blade Runner A specialized

human thanks to implanted memories their

90
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,760
relationship challenges deckard's

91
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,000
perceptions and raises questions about

92
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,879
the nature of humanity

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,200
itself blade runner's visual style is a

94
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:52,239
feast for the eyes a neon Noir landscape

95
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,879
of towering skyscrapers crowded streets

96
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,920
and Perpetual rain all bathed in the

97
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,079
glow of giant video

98
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,760
advertisements this backdrop sets the

99
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,640
tone for a story that grapples with

100
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,560
profound themes of identity memory and

101
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,360
what it truly means to be human it's

102
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,159
against this richly imagined future that

103
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,439
will explore some of buddhism's most

104
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,879
fundamental

105
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,959
concepts as we progress you'll see how

106
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,560
blade runner's philosophical

107
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,919
underpinnings align with Challenge and

108
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,440
illuminate Buddhist thought in

109
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:23,440
surprising ways now that we're all on

110
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,400
the same page let's talk about our first

111
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,400
Buddhist concept hidden within the tyral

112
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,520
corporation's unsettling motto well more

113
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,240
human than human is our motto plade

114
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,440
Runners Los Angeles 2019 confronts us

115
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,600
with the Tyrell corporation's unsettling

116
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,039
motto more human than

117
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,039
human this phrase challenges our very

118
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,919
definition of humanity echoing

119
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:46,479
buddhism's profound inquiries into

120
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,960
Consciousness and

121
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:53,080
identity replicants those bioengineered

122
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:57,199
beings with implanted memories and

123
00:04:53,080 --> 00:05:01,080
emotions blur the line between human and

124
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:04,600
artificial they laugh cry and fear

125
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,639
death sound familiar this ambiguity

126
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,479
forces us to confront Buddhist concepts

127
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,960
of Consciousness and sentients headon

128
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:14,759
Buddhism teaches us about emptiness or

129
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,000
shunyata don't misunderstand this

130
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,560
doesn't mean nothing exists rather it

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,199
suggests that nothing possesses inherent

132
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,240
independent existence the heart Sutra a

133
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:30,479
key Buddhist text says it simply form is

134
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,479
emptiness emptiness is form

135
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,680
this paradoxical statement invites us to

136
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,560
look Beyond surface appearances and

137
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,479
recognize the interdependent nature of

138
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,520
all

139
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:42,680
phenomena through this lens both humans

140
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,560
and replicants in Blade Runner equally

141
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,080
lack self- Essence their identities

142
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,759
memories and experiences arise from

143
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,680
causes and conditions mirroring Buddhist

144
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,080
philosophy's view of our own

145
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,960
identities just as the heart Sutra

146
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,680
challenges us to see the empty nature of

147
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,520
our own existence Blade Runner pushes us

148
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,720
to question the supposed boundary

149
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,360
between human and artificial life

150
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,000
consider Roy BD's tears or Rachel's love

151
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,919
are these emotions less real because

152
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,680
artificial beings experience them

153
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,120
Buddhism argues that the source doesn't

154
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,599
negate the reality or impact of an

155
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,360
emotion this perspective challenges us

156
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:22,639
to extend our compassion Beyond

157
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,720
conventional boundaries a lesson that

158
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,680
resonates in Blade Runner's World and

159
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,280
our

160
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,360
own looking ahead blade runner's

161
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,039
dystopian future Beck us to question if

162
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,759
replicants can be more human than human

163
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,639
what Hidden Truths about Humanity's

164
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,560
Essence might we uncover this Paradox

165
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,440
would challenge even the most

166
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,240
enlightened Buddhist Master if only you

167
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,000
could see what I've seen with your eyes

168
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,160
Roy bat's haunting words open a

169
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,720
fascinating exploration of perception

170
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,240
and reality themes that strike at the

171
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,639
heart of Buddhist philosophy Ridley

172
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,319
Scott uses eyes as a central Motif

173
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,599
distinguishing replicants from humans

174
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,280
with Eerie red lens lers this visual cue

175
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,160
prompts us to question the nature of

176
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,879
perception and Consciousness itself but

177
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,680
the film's symbolism extends Beyond eyes

178
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,720
notice the constant rain drenching the

179
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,520
Los Angeles

180
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,440
cityscape this isn't just mood setting

181
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,120
it's a powerful visual metaphor that

182
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,000
aligns with Buddhist Concepts the

183
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,879
everpresent rain embodies impermanence

184
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,039
or Anika a fundamental Buddhist teaching

185
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,680
just as rain constantly Falls

186
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,639
shifting and changing the city's

187
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,080
appearance our experiences and

188
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,280
self-perception are in constant

189
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,199
flux this visual reminder of

190
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,639
impermanence underscores the transient

191
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,520
nature of the replicant existence and by

192

extension our

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,960
own contrast deckard's Reliance on

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,039
photographs and secondhand information

195
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,800
with Roy bad's enhanced vision and

196
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,800
firsthand experiences this dichotomy

197
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,560
mirrors the Buddhist emphasis on Direct

198
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,680
experience over conceptual knowledge

199
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,120
Buddhism teaches that true understanding

200
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,400
stems from direct experience not just

201
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,000
intellectual grasp a principal Blade

measures empathetic responses to

205
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:16,919
distinguish replicants from humans but

206
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,560
doesn't this suggest that human

207
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,800
perception of replicants is just as

208
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,599
artificial as replicant

209
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,919
eyes this mind-bending concept aligns

210
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,720
with the Buddhist idea of Maya or

211
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,720
Illusion the notion that our

212
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,479
conventional perception of reality may

213
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,440
be less solid than we

214
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:37,240
assume tyrell's statement Commerce is

215
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,640
our goal here at Tyrell more human than

216
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,279
human is our motto takes on new meaning

217
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,720
when we consider how giving replicants

218
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,760
Vision enables them to form identities

219
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:48,920
perceptions and memories from a Buddhist

220
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,640
perspective this touch is on dependent

221
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,040
origination the idea that all phenomena

222
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,839
including our sense of self arise in

223
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,079
dependence upon other

224
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,279
factors Blade Runners rain soaked

225
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:02,880
streets offer more than just neon

226
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:05,079
Reflections they mirror our own clouded

227
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,560
perceptions reminding us that in both

228
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:10,440
the film and Buddhist thought true

229
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,399
Insight transcends mere visual

life father Roy bad's desperate plea to

232
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,120
his creator Echoes a fundamental human

233
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:25,120
desire that Buddhism often addresses the

234
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,839
craving for existence and the fear of

235
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,040
death Roy's quest to extend his limited

236
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,920
lifespan drives the plot

237
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,800
he seeks Tyrell his creator hoping to

238
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,480
overcome his impending

239
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,040
mortality this search for a Creator who

240
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,800
can grant more life parallels pre-b

241
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,839
Buddhist Indian philosophies that sought

242
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,760
Ultimate answers from a Divine

243
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,320
Source from a Buddhist perspective Roy's

244
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,240
desperate desire for more life

245
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,399
exemplifies attachment a key source of

246
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,440
suffering according to the four noble

247
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,360
truths his struggle against his

248
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,519
predetermined lifespan reflects our

249
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,120
human tendency to resist impermanence a

250
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,519
core Buddhist

251
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,800
concept the irony of Roy calling Tyrell

252
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,000
father becomes particularly poignant

253
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,920
through a Buddhist lens Buddhism

254
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,040
encourages non-attachment even to

255
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,360
parental figures recognizing all

256
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,480
relationships as ultimately

257
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,480
impermanent Roy's emotional connection

258
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,839
to his creator despite never having a

259
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,560
true father-son relationship highlights

260
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,640
the complex nature of attachment and

261
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,279
identity this scene compels us to

262
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,279
reflect on our own attitudes towards

263
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,640
mortality and our search for meaning

264
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,880
like Roy we often seek external

265
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,639
solutions to existence as fundamental

266
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,399
problems yet Buddhism suggests that true

267
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,160
peace comes not from extending life

268
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,519
indefinitely but from accepting

269
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,519
impermanence and letting go of

270
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,560
attachments Roy's struggle against

271
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,560
mortality Echoes our own his journey

272
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,959
invites us to confront a crucial

273
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,800
question can we find peace in life's

274
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:58,519
impermanence rather than fighting

275
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:03,639
against it this challenge faces both

276
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:06,480
Blade Runners app ANS and US I've seen

277
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:09,480
things you people wouldn't

278
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,040
believe Roy bat's iconic final speech

279
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,560
resonates deeply with Buddhist Concepts

280
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,720
offering a powerful meditation on

281
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,399
impermanence and the nature of existence

282
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,360
in this pant scene Roy reflects on his

283
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,040
experiences and life's fleeting nature

284
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,440
his Vivid Recollections mirror the

285
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,560
Buddhist practice of mindfulness being

286
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,079
fully present and aware of one's

287
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,519
experiences

288
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,519
yet a Bittersweet quality permeates his

289
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,600
words as he acknowledges these memories

290
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,360
will soon

291
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,839
vanish this recognition of impermanence

292
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,440
or enika in Buddhist terms forms the

293
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,160
speech's emotional

294
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:48,760
core Roy understands that his

295
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:50,959
experiences however extraordinary are

296
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,639
transient this aligns with the Buddhist

297
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,519
teaching that all phenomena are

298
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,240
impermanent and that attachment to

299
00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:00,000
fleeting things leads to suffering as

300
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,680
the dhap a collection of Budd sayings

301
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,839
puts it all conditioned things are

302
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,399
impermanent when one sees this with

303
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,800
wisdom One turns away from

304
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,199
suffering Roy's speech embodies this

305
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,800
realization albeit tinged with the pain

306
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:20,040
of Letting Go remarkably Roy's final act

307
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,959
before death is one of compassion saving

308
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,880
deckard's life in Buddhist thought this

309
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,120
represents a final accumulation of Good

310
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,760
Karma showcasing the potential for

311
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,160
growth and change even in our final

312
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,959
moments

313
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,040
the tension between Roy's acceptance of

314
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,560
his fate and his evident pain at losing

315
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,480
his experiences reflects the Buddhist

316
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,519
concept of Dua often translated as

317
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,519
suffering or

318
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,720
unsatisfactoriness even as he faces his

319
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,519
end with a degree of equinity we sense

320
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,040
the inherent dissatisfaction in

321
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,199
existence Roy's final moments resonate

322
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,120
beyond the screen compelling us to face

323
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:56,639
our own

324
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,320
mortality what extraordinary experiences

325
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,320
color your life how will you reconcile

326
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,000
their inevitable

327
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,760
passing Blade Runner and Buddhism dare

328
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,720
us to Grapple with these profound

329
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,240
realities how can it not know what it

330
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,120
is deckard's question strikes at the

331
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,160
heart of blade runner's most intriguing

332
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,560
mystery is Deckard himself a

333
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,560
replicant this ambiguity serves as a

334
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,480
perfect springboard to explore Buddhist

335
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,720
concepts of self and identity Buddhism

336
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:30,519
challenges the idea of a fixed inherent

337
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,360
self the concept of anata or non-self

338
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,600
suggests that what we perceive as our

339
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,480
self is actually a collection of

340
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,360
everchanging physical and mental

341
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,079
phenomena without a permanent Essence

342
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,959
deckard's uncertainty about his own

343
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:44,480
nature reflects this Buddhist

344
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,839
questioning of fixed

345
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,519
identity the film deliberately leaves

346
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,560
deckard's status ambiguous forcing us to

347
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,120
question the very criteria we use to

348
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,560
define Humanity from a Buddhist

349
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,160
perspective this ambiguity invites us to

350
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,560
examine our own assumptions about

351
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,560
identity and

352
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,880
Consciousness are we really as certain

353
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:07,160
about our own nature as we think is

354
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,920
Deckard a replicant or a human it's the

355
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,839
ultimate who am I

356
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,600
question at least when we have an

357
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,920
existential crisis we don't have to

358
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,920
worry about accidentally being a robot

359
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,680
right deckard's journey of

360
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,959
self-discovery throughout the film

361
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,480
mirrors the Buddhist path of

362
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:25,720
self-inquiry as he questions his

363
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,720
memories emotions and very nature he

364
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,199
engages in a process similar to Buddhist

365
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,240
mindfulness practices which encourage us

366
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:33,839
to observe our thoughts and experiences

367
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,880
without

368
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,959
attachment this uncertainty about

369
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,959
deckard's nature also relates to the

370
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:43,240
Buddhist concept of emptiness shunyata

371
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,600
that we discussed earlier whether

372
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,040
Deckard is human or replicant from this

373
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,480
perspective his ultimate nature is empty

374
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,320
of inherent existence just like

375
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,079
everything

376
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,160
else deckard's identity crisis serves as

377
00:14:55,079 --> 00:15:00,199
a mirror reflecting our own

378
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,279
uncertainties peer into it deep ly what

379
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:05,519
do you see the answer might reshape your

380
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,320
understanding of self and existence a

381
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,279
prospect both thrilling and

382
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,560
unsettling Bladerunner 2049 takes this

383
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,959
identity puzzle even further without

384
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,079
revealing too much the sequel explores

385
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:20,800
replicant reproduction pushing the

386
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,800
boundaries of what defines Humanity this

387
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,279
expansion of the Blade Runner Universe

388
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,759
amplifies The Originals questions

389
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,959
challenging us to reconsider

390
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,959
Consciousness and identity in light of

391
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,319
advancing

392
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:34,759
technology I love

393
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:37,079
you Rachel's Declaration of love to

394
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:39,360
Deckard raises profound questions about

395
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:41,360
the nature of emotions and

396
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,120
relationships themes that resonate

397
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,560
deeply with Buddhist

398
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,399
philosophy Buddhism often discusses love

399
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,560
in terms of meta or loving kindness a

400
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,360
universal unconditional form of love the

401
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,040
relationship between Rachel and deard

402
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,720
challenges us can a replicant truly

403
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,519
experience love is there connection any

404
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,600
l real or meaningful because of Rachel's

405
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,279
artificial

406
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,399
origin from a Buddhist perspective all

407
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,160
our emotions including love arise from

408
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,480
complex conditions and causes they're

409
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,360
not inherent or permanent but part of

410
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,639
the everchanging flow of experience in

411
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,480
this light Rachel's love for Deckard is

412
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,000
just as valid and real as any human

413
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,920
emotion this relationship also brings up

414
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,360
questions of attachment a central

415
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,639
Concept in Buddhism while Buddhism

416
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,839
doesn't View love itself negatively

417
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,480
attachment to people or outcomes can

418
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:38,120
lead to suffering Rachel and deckard's

419
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,759
bond forged in a world of uncertainty

420
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,759
and danger invites us to reflect on how

421
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:46,120
we navigate love and attachment in our

422
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:48,720
own lives moreover their relationship

423
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,560
challenges societal norms and prejudices

424
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,079
much like Buddhism often encourages us

425
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,120
to question conventional thinking by

426
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:58,319
Falling in Love with a replicant Deckard

427
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,920
whether human or replicant himself

428
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:02,720
crosses a boundary that many in his

429
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,520
world would consider taboo Rachel and

430
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,919
deckard's Forbidden Love pushes

431
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,640
boundaries much like Buddhism challenges

432
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,160
conventional thinking their story urges

433
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,600
us to examine our

434
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,600
preconceptions what unexpected forms of

435
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,360
connection might enrich your life if you

436
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,360
dare to open your

437
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:24,000
heart our journey through blade runner's

438
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,760
neonlit streets reveals more than just a

439
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,880
gripping narrative it holds up a mirror

440
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:32,760
to our beliefs about consciousness

441
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,559
identity and Humanity since its release

442
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,559
Blade Runner has captivated not just

443
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,160
film critics but philosophers and

444
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,840
religious Scholars as well many have

445
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,960
drawn parallels between the film's

446
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,720
themes and various schools of thought

447
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,480
including Buddhism the ambiguity

448
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,160
surrounding deckard's nature and the

449
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,440
moral questions raised by the treatment

450
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,440
of replicants have sparked Decades of

451
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,840
debate and Analysis this ongoing

452
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,559
discussion underscores the film's depth

453
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,200
and its relevance to our evolving

454
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,720
understanding of Consciousness and

455
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,960
artificial

456
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,640
intelligence The replicant Quest For

457
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,200
Life and Deckard self-discovery deeply

458
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,960
resonate with Buddhist concepts of

459
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,480
impermanence non-self and

460
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,799
suffering blade runner's ambiguity about

461
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,520
human and replicant identity challenges

462
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:20,159
us to question how we categorize

463
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,799
ourselves and others just as Buddha

464
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:24,240
urged his followers to investigate

465
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:26,919
reality firsthand Blade Runner pushes us

466
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,840
to look Beyond surface appearances it

467
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,799
forces us to consider that consciousness

468
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,799
might exist in forms we've overlooked or

469
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:36,280
undervalued I challenge you to carry

470
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:38,799
these questions into your own life how

471
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,520
do you define your Humanity can you

472
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,000
trust your perceptions and memories how

473
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,400
might embracing impermanence and

474
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,760
non-self transform your

475
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,120
perspective Blade Runner isn't alone in

476
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,280
tackling these profound themes other

477
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,799
sci-fi works like Ghost in the Shell and

478
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,840
exmachina also grapple with questions of

479
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:00,240
Consciousness identity and what it means

480
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,520
to be human the stories much like

481
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,440
Buddhist teachings challenge us to look

482
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,880
beyond the surface and question our

483
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,760
assumptions about the nature of

484
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,520
existence and

485
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,720
self this philosophical Journey doesn't

486
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,400
end when the credits roll like the

487
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,960
origami unicorns in the film these ideas

488
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,400
will unfold in your mind revealing new

489
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,400
layers of meaning over time and hey

490
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,159
remember the next time you're caught in

491
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,039
the rain without an umbrella just

492
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:30,159

sci-fi Noir it won't keep you dry but it
