1
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:08,833
what if I told you that

2
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:10,600
the moment someone becomes enlightened

3
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:13,700
it's said their voice can echo through mountain valleys

4
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,300
a skeletal green figure moments

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,966
away from being destroyed by supernatural demons

6
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:25,266
suddenly opens his mouth and sings words so powerful

7
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:27,566
they transform terror into wisdom

8
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,133
this isn't background meditation music

9
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:31,500
this is the sound of a soul

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,133
breaking free from the darkest karma imaginable

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,833
today we witness the most intense

12
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,000
spiritual breakthrough ever recorded

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,100
and discover why

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,166
Milarepa's songs are still chanted in Tibetan

15
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,066
monasteries 1,000 years later

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,700
can poetry really become the path to enlightenment

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,000
can a voice change an entire civilization

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,000
you're about to find out

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,600
welcome back to Buddha's wisdom

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,466
I'm Matt

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,766
and we're diving into the heart of the most impossible

22
00:00:58,766 --> 00:01:00,866
redemption story in Buddhist history

23
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:04,533
last episode ended with the ultimate cliffhanger

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,433
Milarepa facing supernatural demons

25
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:09,466
in what could be his final test

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,933
three years in what he called the Green Nettle Cave

27
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:15,033
a body turned the color of Jade

28
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,966
from eating nothing but stinging weeds

29
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,800
and now

30
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,266
spiritual forces that could destroy him completely

31
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:23,300
remember how we followed his path

32
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,533
from mass murderer to broken hermit

33
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:28,500
35 people killed with black magic

34
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:31,100
then years of brutal training under Marpa

35
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,833
the translator tower after tower

36
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,100
built and demolished until his hands bled

37
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:37,466
tonight

38
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:39,966
determines whether someone who's committed mass murder

39
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,600
can actually achieve complete enlightenment

40
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:45,566
legends condense years of spiritual practice

41
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:47,766
into this dramatic night of transformation

42
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,666
what you're about to witness created one

43
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,500
of Tibet's greatest masters

44
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:55,300
a figure whose spontaneous songs would heal communities

45
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,100
inspire generations

46
00:01:57,633 --> 00:02:00,500
and prove that no darkness is too deep for redemption

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,800
over the next 25 minutes

48
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,800
you'll witness the exact moment darkness becomes light

49
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,233
you'll hear the first words of what would

50
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:12,900
become known as the hundred thousand songs of Milarepa

51
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,666
and you'll understand why they called him

52
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,833
the singing Saint but first

53
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,900
we need to see if he survives the night

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,966
the demon surrounded Milarepa like a supernatural storm

55
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,666
eyes blazing with accumulated fury

56
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:31,566
claws extended like knives

57
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:33,500
ready to tear apart this skeletal figure

58
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,700
who dared face the weight of mass murder

59
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,100
his verses recall what happened next

60
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,666
as completely unexpected

61
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:42,000
instead of fighting or fleeing

62
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:45,000
Milarepa stood up from his meditation posture

63
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:47,233
looked directly at these manifestations

64
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,500
of his worst karma

65
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,166
and spoke words that changed everything

66
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:53,366
you are not my enemies

67
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:55,733
he said to the terrifying figures surrounding him

68
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,000
you are my teachers

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,933
the demons paused confused by this response

70
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,266
Tibetan elders still say that Milarepa

71
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,200
then did something that defied every survival instinct

72
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,966
he opened his arms as if welcoming beloved friends

73
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,900
and continued speaking to these supernatural forces

74
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,766
his voice grew stronger with each word

75
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:25,666
for years I've tried to run from you through meditation

76
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,900
through cave retreats

77
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,366
through making my body green with nettles

78
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,100
but you've been waiting patiently

79
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,333
to teach me the most important lesson of all

80
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,433
one account describes the lead demon

81
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,966
the one wearing the face of his uncle's wedding guests

82
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:41,400
stepping closer with claws raised

83
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,733
and what lesson is that it demanded

84
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,433
Milarepa's response

85
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:48,366
preserved in the hundred thousand songs

86
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:51,200
created the transformation that made him legendary

87
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:07,766
the moment he spoke these words

88
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,700
his disciples later told something miraculous happened

89
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:12,800
the demons began to dissolve

90
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,600
not destroyed by force but transformed by recognition

91
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,233
as Milarepa accepted complete

92
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:20,600
responsibility for his actions

93
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,666
without defending himself

94
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:23,766
without making excuses

95
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,300
the supernatural manifestations of his guilt

96
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,566
began changing into something else entirely

97
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:34,233
oral traditions tell us them becoming dakini wisdom

98
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,966
beings who dance in the spaces between thoughts

99
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:39,566
teachers who appear in frightening forms

100
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:41,733
to guide students toward enlightenment

101
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,000
and then

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,800
according to monasteries that still preserve this tale

103
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:48,700
something even more extraordinary occurred

104
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:51,766
words began flowing from Milarepa's mouth

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,966
not planned speech not memorized prayers

106
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:56,833
but spontaneous poetry

107
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,400
that seemed to come from awakened consciousness itself

108
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:02,533
in his hundred thousand songs

109
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:05,266
Milarepa actually recorded this pivotal moment

110
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:18,000
legends imagine him singing lines like in the sky

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,300
of mind clouds gather and disperse

112
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:22,766
but the sky itself remains unchanged

113
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:25,233
in the ocean of consciousness

114
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:26,900
waves rise and fall

115
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,400
but the water itself is never disturbed

116
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,866
Tibetan valleys still echo with stories of his voice

117
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,300
carrying impossible distances

118
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,566
through the mountain passes

119
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:38,133
reaching Marpa's house miles away

120
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,966
waking sleeping villagers

121
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:41,366
with words that seemed to heal

122
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:43,000
something broken in their hearts

123
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:45,366
when dawn broke over the mountains

124
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:47,000
one song remembers that Marpa

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,366
the translator appeared at the meditation site

126
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,333
he took one look at his transformed student

127
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:55,133
and smiled for the first time in years

128
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,000
the killer is dead he reportedly said

129
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:00,700
what remains is a master

130
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,633
Milarapa no longer green and skeletal

131
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:07,266
but somehow radiant despite his physical condition

132
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:10,866
bowed to his teacher and sang another spontaneous verse

133
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,066
three years of caves and years of towers

134
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:17,100
all preparing for this single night

135
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,566
when the student finally disappears

136
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,333
the teacher's work is complete

137
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,400
Tibetan monasteries still chant this story

138
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,233
of the moment

139
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:28,466
Milarepa achieved what Buddhism calls rigpa

140
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,366
direct recognition of the awakened state

141
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:32,500
that had always been present

142
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,566
beneath the layers of guilt and suffering

143
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:36,833
but his transformation was about to

144
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,566
become even more extraordinary

145
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,533
because when consciousness awakens completely

146
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,266
it cannot help but sing

147
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,233
his poetry describes what happened

148
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:51,433
after his enlightenment

149
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:53,533
as unlike anything in Buddhist history

150
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:56,700
most realized masters teach through explanations

151
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,733
through guided meditation

152
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,966
through philosophical discussions

153
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:04,000
Milaripa's awakened consciousness expressed itself

154
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,300
through spontaneous songs

155
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,133
that seemed to heal whatever they touched

156
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:10,333
what made his songs different from ordinary poetry

157
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,533
each verse emerged directly from the enlightened state

158
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,866
addressing the exact

159
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:17,066
spiritual needs of whoever was listening

160
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:18,566
unlike written teachings

161
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:20,533
that speak generally to all readers

162
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,300
milaripa songs seemed to know the specific pain

163
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,566
each person carried

164
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:28,566
villagers described incredible stories

165
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:30,300
about the power of his voice

166
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,766
when he sang near a mountainside scarred by landslides

167
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:37,366
new vegetation began growing from damaged rock

168
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:39,966
when his songs echoed through valleys

169
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:42,966
even the wind seemed to pause and listen

170
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:44,766
but his voice carried something

171
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:46,766
deeper than supernatural power

172
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,766
it carried the sound of a soul that had faced its worst

173
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:52,366
karma accepted it completely

174
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,133
and transformed it into compassion

175
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,133
can you imagine what that sounds like

176
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,933
the voice of someone who's been to hell and back

177
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,500
who's carried the weight of 35 murders

178
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:07,600
and emerged not bitter but overflowing with love

179
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,033
the ultimate test came when word reached the community

180
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,766
still traumatized by memories of the supernatural storm

181
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:15,766
that had killed 35 wedding guests

182
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:16,733
years earlier

183
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:20,000
when residents recognized this transformed figure

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,300
as the sorcerer who had caused their suffering

185
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,333
they were terrified some fled

186
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,100
others grabbed weapons

187
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:29,500
children hid behind their parents

188
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:30,966
this skeletal green

189
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:33,166
tinged figure looked like what villagers called

190
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,333
a hungry ghost

191
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,966
a spirit of someone who had died with terrible karma

192
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:38,266
and couldn't find peace

193
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:41,400
instead of defending himself or making excuses

194
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:44,033
monasteries preserve the story of Milarepa

195
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:45,466
sitting in the village center

196
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,233
and beginning to sing about the nature

197
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,166
of forgiveness

198
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,266
his voice according to those who heard it

199
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:53,566
carried a quality that made anger impossible

200
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,466
to maintain

201
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:56,466
not because he was using

202
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:58,333
some kind of supernatural charm

203
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,033
but because genuine remorse

204
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:02,500
has a sound that hearts recognize instantly

205
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,766
one of his most famous verses

206
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,533
actually recorded in his hundred thousand songs

207
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,166
captures this moment

208
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,066
then legends

209
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:24,700
imagine him singing directly about their shared pain

210
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,766
villagers described weeping as they listened

211
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:38,600
not from sadness but from a deep healing

212
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,933
they couldn't explain the sound of his voice

213
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,333
the obvious sincerity of his remorse

214
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,333
the genuine transformation they could see and feel

215
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,900
gradually melted years of accumulated grief and anger

216
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,066
by the end of his songs

217
00:09:54,366 --> 00:09:56,300
the community that had feared him for years

218
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,766
was asking for his teachings

219
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:00,066
can you imagine that moment

220
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,400
the people whose relatives you murdered

221
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,666
asking you for spiritual guidance

222
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:08,533
the transformation had to be complete authentic

223
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:10,100
undeniable

224
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:14,600
but the most extraordinary encounter was still coming

225
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:15,900
when Milarepa

226
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,300
finally returned to visit his mother and sister

227
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:20,000
the reunion seemed impossible

228
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,600
after everything that had happened

229
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:22,900
his mother

230
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,600
who had demanded he learn black magic for revenge

231
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,800
took one look at her transformed son and collapsed

232
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,166
she recognized immediately what her anger had created

233
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,333
and what it had ultimately become

234
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:36,800
his verses recall her

235
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,300
confessing her role in turning him into a killer

236
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:40,666
begging forgiveness

237
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,866
for her part in the deaths of 35 innocent people

238
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,866
Milarepa's response as preserved in his collected songs

239
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,966
demonstrates the complete transformation

240
00:10:49,966 --> 00:10:52,700
from vengeful sorcerer to enlightened master

241
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,966
his sister Peta

242
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:15,366
who had watched him transform from beloved brother

243
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:17,666
to mass murderer to enlightened Yogi

244
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,666
finally found peace with the impossible journey

245
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,966
they had all survived

246
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,433
she later told people that her brother's voice

247
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,766
had changed completely

248
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:28,766
where once it carried hatred and magical power

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,833
now it overflowed with a tenderness

250
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,566
that could heal ancient wounds

251
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:34,833
this was the moment that marked

252
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,366
Milarepa's true emergence

253
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,866
as a spiritual master not when he defeated demons

254
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,366
but when he healed the hearts of those he had harmed

255
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:43,166
most

256
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:45,800
the songs were beginning to spread throughout Tibet

257
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,166
and they would change everything

258
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,066
over the next several years

259
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,366
Tibetan valleys remember Milarepa

260
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:58,900
leaving Marpa's guidance to begin legendary wandering

261
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,133
throughout the most remote regions of the plateau

262
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:03,300
the high passes were treacherous

263
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,366
where wind could freeze breath in your lungs

264
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:07,800
and thin air made every step a struggle

265
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:11,166
winter storms could trap travelers for months in caves

266
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,933
barely large enough for survival

267
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,266
yet in these impossible conditions

268
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:18,566
Milarepa thrived

269
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:21,066
unlike conventional Buddhist teachers

270
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:22,700
who established monasteries

271
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,866
Milarepa became known for appearing

272
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:26,666
wherever suffering needed healing

273
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,900
often in places so isolated

274
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,000
that finding him required genuine spiritual dedication

275
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,900
his teaching method was revolutionary

276
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,133
rather than formal dharma talks

277
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:40,400
he would assess each person's specific spiritual needs

278
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,000
and sing spontaneous verses

279
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,100
that addressed their exact situation

280
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:45,600
the silence of high

281
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,033
mountain caves carried an otherworldly quality

282
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,133
when wind stopped howling and snow ceased falling

283
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,433
the stillness was so profound

284
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:55,566
it seemed to press against your eardrums

285
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:58,100
in these moments of absolute quiet

286
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,400
his voice would emerge

287
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,566
like sunlight breaking through storm clouds

288
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,000
one song remembers a wealthy merchant

289
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,833
who climbed dangerous mountain passes

290
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,266
searching for milarepa

291
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:10,600
the merchant had everything material

292
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,266
comfort could provide but felt completely empty inside

293
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:16,566
when he finally found Milarepa

294
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:17,500
meditating in a cave

295
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
barely large enough for one person

296
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,466
frost coating the stone walls

297
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,666
breath visible in the frigid air

298
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,566
the merchant offered gold and jewels

299
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:27,066
in exchange for teachings

300
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:28,900
for a long moment

301
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,700
only the sound of wind outside broke the cave silence

302
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:34,200
then Milarepa's voice filled the space

303
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,633
as preserved in his collected verses

304
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:39,100
we hear Milarepa responding with lines like

305
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:41,300
you carry treasures up the mountain

306
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
seeking something you already possess

307
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,033
the wealth you seek cannot be bought

308
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,666
it can only be recognized

309
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,566
look at this cave

310
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:53,066
nothing here belongs to me yet I lack nothing

311
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,033
what would you trade for

312
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:57,166
a single song that could heal your emptiness

313
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,066
one disciple's account says

314
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:01,866
that the merchant left his material wealth in the cave

315
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:03,933
return to his valley

316
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:07,366
and began living with a simplicity and contentment

317
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:09,400
that amazed everyone who knew him

318
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,100
but

319
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,933
not everyone was ready for Milarepa's radical message

320
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,766
when his growing reputation attracted attention

321
00:14:15,766 --> 00:14:17,700
from established religious authorities

322
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:19,800
they questioned whether this wandering

323
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,000
cave dweller could really possess genuine

324
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,333
spiritual attainments

325
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,066
a renowned scholar monk arranged a formal challenge

326
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,566
expecting to expose what he assumed

327
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:31,333
was superficial realization

328
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:33,466
the scholar posed complex

329
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:35,900
philosophical questions about emptiness

330
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,366
and meditation stages

331
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:40,366
Milarepa's response was unexpected

332
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:42,466
he began singing verses

333
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,566
that directly demonstrated the understanding

334
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:45,466
being tested

335
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,066
you ask about emptiness

336
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:49,800
as if it were separate from form

337
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,966
but look at this monastery

338
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,200
solid walls built from empty space

339
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:58,833
the scholar who had come to expose Milarepa as a fraud

340
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,166
instead requested teachings from him

341
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,766
perhaps the most significant challenge

342
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:05,366
came from followers of Bon

343
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:08,366
Tibet's ancient pre Buddhist tradition

344
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,433
who claimed his powers were simply

345
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:12,333
continuation of black magic

346
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,700
monasteries still chant Milarepa's response

347
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,666
demonstrating complete transformation

348
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,566
from sorcerer to saint

349
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,800
rather than displaying supernatural abilities

350
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:27,066
he invited his challengers to examine his motivation

351
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,900
his challengers

352
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,000
became some of his most devoted students

353
00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:47,633
this pattern defined his wandering years

354
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:48,200
the master

355
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,600
who had once used supernatural power for revenge

356
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,400
now used awakened abilities

357
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,133
solely for healing and teaching

358
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:00,933
after years of wandering

359
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,300
Tibetan elders still say that Milarepa's reputation

360
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,000
transcended religious boundaries

361
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,066
and touched every level of society

362
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:10,433
communities throughout the region

363
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:12,933
began requesting visits from the singing yogi

364
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:14,366
his influence spread

365
00:16:14,366 --> 00:16:16,500
not through institutional authority

366
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:18,400
but through transformed lives

367
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,933
that served as living testimonies to his teachings

368
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,633
oral traditions recall villages

369
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:26,200
where his brief visits left lasting changes

370
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,900
communities divided by old feuds

371
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,400
found reconciliation

372
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,700
after hearing his verses about forgiveness

373
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,600
regions plagued by natural disasters

374
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:38,200
reported improved conditions after his presence

375
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:42,200
but what made his influence unique was its authenticity

376
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,033
unlike religious authorities

377
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:46,100
who demanded respect based on position

378
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,500
Milarepa's authority came entirely from the obvious

379
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,566
genuineness of his transformation

380
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:53,766
people could see that this was someone

381
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:55,300
who had genuinely walked the path

382
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,266
from darkness to light

383
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,166
his scarred hands told the story of years

384
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,733
building towers for Marpa

385
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:05,266
his lean frame and traces of green coloration

386
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:06,566
preserved evidence of cave years

387
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:07,700
sustained by nettles

388
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,033
his eyes carried the depth of someone

389
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:12,300
who had faced the worst karma imaginable

390
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,900
and emerged victorious

391
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,866
one song preserves accounts of hardened criminals

392
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:19,000
abandoning violence

393
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,933
after hearing his verses about karma

394
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:23,466
wealthy merchants gave away fortunes

395
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:24,266
after his songs

396
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:26,866
revealed the emptiness of material accumulation

397
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,233
scholars burned books and sought direct experience

398
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:32,200
after his poetry showed them the limitations

399
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,766
of intellectual understanding

400
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,366
these transformations happened spontaneously

401
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,733
not through lengthy instruction or formal ceremonies

402
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,200
but through immediate recognition of awakened

403
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,533
consciousness expressing itself through song

404
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,666
his disciples told of a particularly moving encounter

405
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,800
with a young woman

406
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,300
who had lost her entire family to disease

407
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,466
leaving her consumed by anger

408
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:58,566
at the apparent injustice of existence

409
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,700
the old songs recall Milarepa finding her

410
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,766
preparing to throw herself from a cliff

411
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:07,566
choosing death over continuing to live with such pain

412
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
he didn't try to talk her out of suicide

413
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,266
or offer philosophical explanations

414
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:13,966
instead

415
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,500
he sang about his own journey from despair to awakening

416
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:30,900
she stepped back from the cliff

417
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,133
and eventually found her own path to healing

418
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:35,700
this story echoes the deeper pattern

419
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,366
we saw in his family reunion

420
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,500
showing how genuine transformation

421
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,766
creates ripples of healing

422
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:42,500
that touch everyone around it

423
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,466
the killer who became a saint

424
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,066
the destroyer who became a healer

425
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,666
the voice of hatred that became a song of compassion

426
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,000
as the oral traditions still preserved records

427
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,533
Milarepa actually wrote

428
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,700
legends imagine him

429
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,200
adding verses that capture his essential message

430
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,333
your worst mistakes can become your greatest teachers

431
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,333
your deepest darkness can birth your brightest light

432
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:19,766
nothing is wasted everything serves the path

433
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:22,266
the singing saint had emerged from

434
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:23,400
the depths of karma

435
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,100
to prove that redemption is possible

436
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,100
for anyone willing to face their actions completely

437
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,333
accept responsibility without excuses

438
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:32,233
and trust

439
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:34,800
the transformative power of awakened consciousness

440
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,166
by this time his voice was known throughout Tibet

441
00:19:38,566 --> 00:19:40,733
students were beginning to gather around him

442
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
the foundations were being laid for what would

443
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,166
become one of Buddhism's most influential lineages

444
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:49,133
and his greatest adventures were still ahead

445
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:50,900
the wandering yogi

446
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,766
was about to become something even more extraordinary

447
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,433
can you imagine

448
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:59,900
the courage required to face your worst mistakes

449
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,266
accept complete responsibility

450
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:04,166
and transform them into wisdom

451
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:05,366
that's the question

452
00:20:05,366 --> 00:20:07,566
Milarepa's story asks every one of us

453
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:10,166
what impossible transformation awaits

454
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,200
on the other side of your deepest regrets

455
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,866
the singing saint who emerged from darkness

456
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:16,933
to become Tibet's beloved master

457
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:19,366
proves that no one is beyond redemption

458
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,933
no mistake is too great no fall is too deep

459
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,166
if Milarepa's journey from killer to saint

460
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,166
has moved you if you believe transformation is possible

461
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,800
even after the worst failures

and discover how a wandering

466
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,366
yogi became one of history's most influential teachers

467
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,133
what songs would you sing if you achieved enlightenment

468

leave a comment below

469
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:00,300
sometimes the path to healing begins with admitting

470
00:21:00,366 --> 00:21:01,400
we need it

471
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:05,366
to be continued in Part 4 the great Yogi
