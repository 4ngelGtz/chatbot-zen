day you're aligning yourself with the

160
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,479
very essence of the Buddhist

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,800
teachings you're reminding yourself of

every

168
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,560
morning as you continue to deepen your

169
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,400
connection to the present moment through

170
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,160
your morning practices it's important to

171
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,120
remember that the wisdom of the Buddha

172
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,479
isn't just about cultivating a peaceful

173
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,360
mind

174
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,080
it's also about honoring and caring for

175
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,120
the physical vessel that allows us to

176
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,919
experience this precious human existence

177
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,440
and one powerful way to do this is by

178
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:16,360
incorporating gentle stretching or a

179
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,280
short yoga sequence into your routine

180
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,120
not only does this help to awaken and

181
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,639
energize the body after a restful

182
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,039
night's sleep but it also serves as a

183
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,879
beautiful metaphor for the flexibility

184
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,960
strength and Grace that the Buddhist

185
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,840
teachings encourage us to embody just as

186
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,160
we mindfully move our bodies through a

187
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,000
series of gentle postures consciously

188
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,520
breathing and releasing areas of tension

189
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,759
we're also practicing The Art of Letting

190
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,360
Go letting go of physical tightness and

191
