2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,400
picture this you're at a dinner party

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,000
and the conversation turns to religion

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,279
someone mentions Buddhism and suddenly

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,520
Everyone's an

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,560
expert isn't that the one where they

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,400
worship

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,119
Buddha don't they all just meditate and

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,840
chant I heard they're not allowed to own

10
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:30,439
anything the misconceptions start flying

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,040
faster than a kung fu master in a

12
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,320
Hollywood movie but hold on a minute my

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,360
friends before you start nodding along

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,079
or arguing back let's take a step back

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,840
and separate the facts from the fiction

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,440
because when it comes to Buddhism

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,160
there's a lot of misinformation out

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,840
there and it's time we set the record

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,199
straight welcome to Buddha's wisdom I'm

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,640
your host Matt and I'll be your

21
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:53,520
navigator on this journey through the

22
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,120
often misunderstood world of Buddhist

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,000
philosophy in

24
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,600
practice with great wisdom comes great

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,960
misunderstanding

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,880
over the centuries as Buddhism spread

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,439
from its birthplace in India to the Far

28
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,200
Corners of the globe it picked up a few

29
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:13,040
myths and misconceptions along the way

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,920
some of these myths are harmless While

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,720
others can seriously distort our

32
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,360
understanding of what Buddhism is all

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,600
about so are you ready to put on your

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,680
mythbusting hat and dive deep into the

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,320
heart of Buddhist wisdom are you

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,920
prepared to have your preconceptions

37
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,920
challenged and your mind

38
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,920
expanded then let's get started

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,320
let's start with a big one the idea that

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,200
Buddhism is a religion without a god

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,680
while Buddhism doesn't worship a Creator

42
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,479
God like in abrahamic religions it does

43
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,439
acknowledge the existence of various

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,840
Spiritual Beings such as dvas and

45
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,479
bodhisattvas in Buddhism there is a

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,040
recognition of these highly Advanced

47
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,040
beings on the path to

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,240
Enlightenment however they are not

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,039
woried as gods in the traditional sense

50
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,119
but rather respected and sometimes

51
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:04,280
called upon for guidance and support the

52
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,640
focus in Buddhism is on individual

53
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,000
spiritual growth and the realization of

54
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,760
One's Own innate wisdom and compassion

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,360
the ultimate goal is not to please or

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,560
worship a God but to awaken to the true

57
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,519
nature of reality and to live in harmony

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,519
with oneself and

59
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,640
others closely related is the belief

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,120
that Buddhists worship the Buddha as a

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,360
god this is not the case the Buddha or

62
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,120
sidhartha gotama was a human being who

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,400
attained Enlightenment through his own

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,360
efforts and then taught others the path

65
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,599
to Liberation from

66
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,920
suffering Buddhists do not see the

67
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,120
Buddha as a deity to be worshiped but

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,959
rather as a great teacher and an example

69
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,120
of what is possible for all beings in

70
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,840
Buddhist practice the Buddha is revered

71
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,440
and respected for his wisdom and

72
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,400
compassion but he is not prayed to or

73
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,720
worshiped in the same way that a god

74
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,239
might be in other

75
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,560
religions Buddhists May bow or make

76
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,680
offerings before for a statue of the

77
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,280
Buddha but these are acts of respect and

78
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,159
gratitude not

79
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,000
worship the Buddha himself encouraged

80
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:11,519
his followers not to rely on him as a

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
savior but to take responsibility for

82
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,599
their own spiritual growth and to find

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,920
the truth within themselves he

84
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,200
emphasized that he was simply a guide

85
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,360
pointing the way to Enlightenment but

86
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,360
that each individual must walk the path

87
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,519
themselves many think Buddhism is all

88
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,720
about

89
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,720
meditation while meditation is certainly

90
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,760
an important part of Buddhist practice

91
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,360
it's not the only aspect of the

92
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,080
tradition Buddhism is a comprehensive

93
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,680
system that encompasses a wide range of

94
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,720
teachings and practices designed to help

95
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,920
individuals develop wisdom compassion

96
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,040
and inner peace meditation is just one

97
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,640
of the many tools that Buddhism offers

98
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,239
for cultivating these

99
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,120
qualities in addition to meditation

100
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,599
Buddhism emphasizes the importance of

101
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,480
ethical conduct the cultivation of

102
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,760
positive mental States and the

103
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,280
development of wisdom through study and

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,920
reflection the Buddha taught the Noble

105
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,079
eight-fold Path which includes eight key

106
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,440
areas of practice right view right

107
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:20,320
intention right speech right action

108
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,320
right livelihood right effort right

109
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,040
mindfulness and right concentration each

110
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,400
of these areas is considered essential

111
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,440
for progressing on the path to

112
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,520
Enlightenment and they work together to

113
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,520
create a holistic approach to spiritual

114
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,240
growth here's a geographical

115
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,639
misconception Buddhism is often seen as

116
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,280
only popular in Asian countries such as

117
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:48,080
India China Japan and Southeast Asia

118
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,000
while it's true that Buddhism originated

119
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,720
in India and has had a profound

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,360
influence on the cultures and societies

121
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,520
of Asia it's important to recognize that

122
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,199
Buddhism is now a global religion with

123
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,400
followers all over the

124
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,440
world in the past past Century Buddhism

125
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,680
has spread far beyond its traditional

126
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,680
Asian boundaries and has taken root in

127
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,560
many Western countries this is due in

128
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,440
part to increased Global connectivity as

129
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,360
well as a growing interest in eastern

130
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,479
spirituality and practices like

131
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,199
meditation and

132
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,639
mindfulness today there are thriving

133
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,199
Buddhist communities in countries like

134
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:27,440
the United States Canada Europe and

135
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,000
Australia these communities include both

136
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,479
immigrant populations from Asian

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,160
countries as well as Western converts

138
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:34,400
who have been drawn to the teachings and

139
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,000
practices of

140
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,360
Buddhism many westerners have found in

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,639
Buddhism a compelling alternative to

142
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,880
traditional Western religions one that

143
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,400
emphasizes personal experience

144
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,120
self-inquiry and the cultivation of

145
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,080
wisdom and compassion Buddhist teachers

146
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,240
from various Traditions have traveled to

147
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,000
the west to share the teachings and many

148
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,479
Western practitioners have also traveled

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,039
to Asia to study with Masters and

150
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,319
immerse themselves in the culture and

151
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,000
practices of

152
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,880
Buddhism in addition to the growth of

153
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,800
Buddhist communities in the west

154
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,880
Buddhism has also had a significant

155
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,840
influence on Western culture more

156
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,680
broadly Buddhist ideas and practices

157
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,240
have been adopted and adapted by many

158
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,919
fields including psychology neuroscience

159
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,599
and even business and

160
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:23,800
Leadership mindfulness meditation in

161
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:26,120
particular has become increasingly

162
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,800
mainstream in the west with countless

163
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,039
books apps and programs designed to help

164
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,599
people cultivate greater awareness

165
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,720
resilience and

166
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:38,160
well-being while mindfulness is often

167
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,919
presented in a secular context its roots

168
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,400
in Buddhist practice are

169
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,599
undeniable so while Buddhism may have

170
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,080
its Origins and deepest roots in Asia it

171
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:49,880
is now truly a global religion with

172
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,319
followers and influence all over the

173
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,840
world as the teachings and practices of

174
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,639
Buddhism continue to spread and adapt to

175
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,840
new

176
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,000
contexts it's likely that the global

177
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,039
reach of this ancient tradition will

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,039
only continue to

179
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,039
grow some mistakenly label Buddhists as

180
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,879
pagans this idea likely stems from a

181
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,400
misunderstanding of the term Pagan and a

182
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:18,120
lack of familiarity with the core

183
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,879
teachings and practices of Buddhism

184
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,639
historically the term Pagan was used by

185
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,199
early Christians to refer to anyone who

186
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,240
was not Christian Jewish or Muslim it

187
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,280
was often associated with polytheistic

188
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,800
or nature-based religions that were seen

189
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:36,319
as primitive or idolatrous by Christian

190
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,919
authorities however Buddhism does not

191
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,000
easily fit into this category while

192
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:44,440
Buddhism does recognize the existence of

193
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
various deities and Spiritual Beings it

194
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,520
does not teach the worship of these

195
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,479
entities as a means to Salvation or

196
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,560
Enlightenment in fact the Buddha himself

197
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,599
rejected the idea of a supreme Creator

198
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,159
God and emphasized the importance of

199
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:00,000
individual responsibility and

200
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:02,199
self-reliance on the path to to

201
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,520
Awakening he taught that the ultimate

202
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,039
goal of Buddhist practice is to realize

203
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,680
the true nature of reality and to free

204
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,800
oneself from the cycle of suffering not

205
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,400
to appease or seek favor from external

206
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,479
deities Buddhism also differs from many

207
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,360
Pagan religions in its emphasis on

208
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:22,319
ethical conduct mental cultivation and

209
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,440
the development of wisdom and

210
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,639
compassion the Buddha taught a way of

211
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,720
life based on moral discipline

212
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,000
mindfulness and the cultivation of

213
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,360
positive mental States rather than the

214
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,800
performance of rituals or the invocation

215
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,120
of Supernatural powers that being said

216
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,479
it's important to recognize that

217
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,760
Buddhism has often coexisted and blended

218
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,120
with local religious Traditions as it is

219
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,240
spread to different parts of the world

220
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,440
in some cases this has led to the

221
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,000
incorporation of indigenous deities

222
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,600
rituals and beliefs into Buddhist

223
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,279
practice however these local adaptations

224
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,800
do not negate the core teachings and

225
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,640
values of Buddhism which remain grounded

226
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,720
in the Buddha original insights into the

227
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,320
nature of reality and the path to

228
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,920
Liberation from

229
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,880
suffering ultimately while Buddhism may

230
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,000
share some superficial similarities with

231
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,839
certain Pagan Traditions it is a

232
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,600
distinct and unique spiritual path that

233
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,399
cannot be easily categorized or reduced

234
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,800
to a single label by appreciating the

235
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,839
depth and complexity of Buddhist

236
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,079
teachings and practices we can move

237
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,839
Beyond simplistic misconceptions and

238
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:31,320
gain a more accurate understanding of

239
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,320
this ancient and enduring tradition

240
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,320
it's commonly believed that all

241
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,279
Buddhists are

242
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,320
vegetarians while it's true that many

243
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,640
Buddhists choose to follow a vegetarian

244
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,440
or vegan diet it's not a strict

245
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,160
requirement for all adherence of the

246
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,040
tradition the Buddha himself did not

247
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,640
explicitly prohibit the consumption of

248
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,800
meat but he did encourage his followers

249
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,240
to avoid causing harm to any living

250
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,440
beings including animals in some

251
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,440
Buddhist texts the Buddha is described

252
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,920
as accepting meat that was offered to

253
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,880
him as alms as long as the animal was

254
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,560
not killed specifically for

255
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,880
him different Buddhist traditions and

256
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,480
individual practitioners have

257
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,920
interpreted this guidance in various

258
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,560
ways some Buddhists choose to follow a

259
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,160
strict vegetarian or vegan diet seeing

260
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,720
it as a way to practice compassion and

261
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,839
nonviolence towards all sensient

262
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,640
beings Others May consume meat but only

263
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,600
if it comes from animals that have died

264
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,200
naturally or were not killed

265
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,160
specifically for

266
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,440
food in some Buddhist countries such as

267
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,160
Tibet and Mongolia where vegetarian

268
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,240
options may be limited due to the harsh

269
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,399
climate and terrain Buddhists have

270
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,279
traditionally included meat in their

271
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,200
diets however many Tibetan Buddhist

272
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,240
monasteries and practitioners still

273
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,360
observe vegetarianism whenever possible

274
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,120
ultimately the decision to follow a

275
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,079
vegetarian or non-vegetarian Diet is a

276
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,320
personal choice for each Buddhist

277
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,720
practitioner the key principle is to

278
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,160
strive to minimize harm and cultivate

279
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,240
compassion for all beings and to make

280
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,240
dietary choices that align with one's

281
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,639
own understanding and application of

282
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,639
Buddhist

283
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,360
ethics a common misunderstanding about

284
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,200
Buddhism is that it's a religion only

285
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,920
for monks and nuns and that lay people

286
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,680
cannot fully participate in the practice

287
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,320
this is not the case at

288
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,320
all while monastic life is an important

289
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,480
part of the Buddhist tradition the

290
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,600
teachings and practices of Buddhism are

291
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,440
available to anyone who is interested

292
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,720
regardless of their lifestyle or

293
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,360
vocation the Buddha himself taught that

294
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,920
the path to Liberation is open to all

295
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,040
and that anyone can benefit from

296
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,680
practicing the Dharma or Buddhist

297
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,720
teachings in fact the Buddha had many

298
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,360
lay followers who were householders

299
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,760
merchants and people from all walks of

300
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,320
life he encouraged them to practice

301
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,639
generosity ethics and mindfulness in

302
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,839
their daily lives and to find ways to

303
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,360
apply the teach teachings to their

304
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,000
unique

305
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,720
circumstances in Buddhist countries it's

306
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,360
common for Lay people to participate in

307
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,079
religious ceremonies offer support to

308
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,560
monasteries and practice meditation and

309
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:14,360
other spiritual disciplines in their

310
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,279
homes or at local

311
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,920
temples many lay Buddhists also study

312
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,440
Buddhist texts attend teachings by monks

313
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,959
or lay teachers and go on retreats to

314
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,480
deepen their understanding and practice

315
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,480
while it's true that monks and nuns have

316
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,959
the opportunity to dedicate themselves

317
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,959
fully to the study and practice of

318
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,760
Buddhism this doesn't mean that lay

319
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,399
people are any less capable of realizing

320
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,959
the benefits of the teachings in fact

321
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,760
the Buddha emphasize that it's not the

322
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:43,440
outward form of one's life that matters

323
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,519
most but the quality of one's mind and

324
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,639
actions the Buddha taught that true

325
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,160
happiness and freedom come from within

326
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,000
and that anyone can cultivate these

327
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,839
qualities through diligent practice and

328
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,800
skillful living whether one is a monk a

329
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,320
nun or a lay person the key is to apply

330
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,920
the teachings in a way that is authentic

331
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
and meaningful to one 's own life and

332
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,480
circumstances some think Buddhism is

333
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,360
entirely anti-materialistic and that

334
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,800
Buddhists reject all worldly possessions

335
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,600
and Comforts while it's true that

336
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,399
Buddhism encourages a certain degree of

337
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,959
Detachment from material things it's not

338
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,040
quite as simple as renouncing all

339
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,720
worldly

340
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,880
possessions the Buddha taught the

341
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,000
middleway which is a path of moderation

342
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,320
between the extremes of self-indulgence

343
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,519
and

344
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,680
self-denial he recognized that both

345
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,079
extreme asceticism and unchecked

346
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,199
Hedonism can be obstacles to spiritual

347
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,680
growth and

348
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:39,800
well-being in the Buddhist view the

349
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,000
problem is not material things in and of

350
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,279
themselves but rather our attachment to

351
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,040
them when we cling to possessions or

352
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,519
seek happiness solely through external

353
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,399
means we inevitably set ourselves up for

354
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:52,279
disappointment and suffering all

355
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,680
material things are impermanent and

356
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:56,600
subject to change and true happiness and

357
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,240
contentment must come from

358
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,040
within however this doesn't mean that

359
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,560
Buddhists reject all material Comforts

360
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,399
or live in complete poverty the Buddha

361
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,399
himself accepted gifts and donations

362
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,240
from lay followers and many Buddhist

363
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,920
monasteries throughout history have been

364
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,800
well supported by their

365
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,160
communities the key is to cultivate a

366
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,720
healthy relationship with material

367
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,240
things one characterized by gratitude

368
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,440
generosity and

369
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,800
non-attachment Buddhists are encouraged

370
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,199
to use their resources wisely and to

371
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,959
share with others whenever possible

372
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,839
recognizing that true wealth comes from

373
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,199
inner peace and contentment not from

374
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,560
external

375
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,320
possessions in the Buddhist tradition

376
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,160
lay followers are encouraged to live

377
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,240
responsibly and to provide for their

378
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,440
families and communities while also

379
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,519
practicing generosity and supporting the

380
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,600
monastic sanha monks and nuns on the

381
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:53,920
other hand take vows of Simplicity and

382
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,480
renunciation letting go of worldly

383
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,480
possessions in order to dedicate

384
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,959
themselves fully to spiritual

385
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,600
practice ultimately the Buddhist

386
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,639
approach to material things is one of

387
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,480
balance and wisdom by learning to let go

388
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,680
of our attachments and to find

389
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,000
contentment in the present moment we can

390
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,639
enjoy the benefits of material life

391
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,880
without being enslaved by them and by

392
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:18,160
cultivating generosity and sharing with

393
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,079
others we can use our resources to

394
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,120
create greater happiness and well-being

395
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,120
for ourselves and for the world around

396
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,680
us people often see Buddhism as

397
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,959
pessimistic due to its focus on

398
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,519
suffering uffing while it's true that

399
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,199
the Buddha taught extensively about the

400
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,839
nature of suffering and The Human

401
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,560
Condition this doesn't mean that

402
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,519
Buddhism is inherently pessimistic in

403
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,959
fact the central message of Buddhism is

404
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,120
one of Hope and

405
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:48,639
Liberation the Buddha taught that while

406
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,560
suffering is an inevitable part of life

407
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,480
it is possible to find Freedom from

408
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,720
suffering through the practice of the

409
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,519
eight-fold

410
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:00,160
path this path offers a practical way to

411
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:02,959

to live a life of Greater happiness and

413
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,040
fulfillment the Buddha's teachings on

414
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,240
suffering are not meant to be depressing

415
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,440
or discouraging but rather to help us

416
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,600
see the reality of The Human Condition

417
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,000
with greater Clarity and understanding

418
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,000
by acknowledging the presence of

419
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,199
suffering in our lives we can begin to

420
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,040
develop the tools and insights needed to

421
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:26,079
transform our relationship to it in

422
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Buddhism suffering is seen as a teacher

423
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,480
and a catalyst for spiritual growth

424
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,240
it is through our struggles and

425
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,880
challenges that we have the opportunity

426
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,160
to develop Greer resilience compassion

427
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,000
and

428
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,880
wisdom the Buddha taught that by

429
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,800
changing our perspective on suffering

430
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,319
and cultivating positive mental States

431
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,160
Like Loving kindness and Equanimity we

432
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:49,519
can find greater peace and happiness in

433
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,560
the midst of life's

434
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,759
difficulties moreover Buddhism places a

435
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,360
strong emphasis on the cultivation of

436
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:00,279
joy and contentment in the present

437
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,759
moment the practice of mindfulness which

438
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:04,839
is Central to Buddhist Meditation helps

439
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,720
individuals to let go of anxieties about

440
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,319
the future and regrets about the past

441
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,520
and to find a sense of peace and

442
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,839
well-being in the Here and Now Buddhist

443
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,000
teachings also emphasize the

444
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,880
interconnectedness of all beings and the

445
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,880
potential for awakening that lies within

446
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,120
each

447
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,880
individual this perspective offers a

448
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,360
hopeful and empowering vision of The

449
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,919
Human Condition one in which we all have

450
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,559
the capacity to find Freedom from

451
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:31,400
suffering and to live with greater

452
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,400
wisdom and

453
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,640
compassion you've probably seen statues

454
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,360
or images of a smiling bald rotund man

455
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,520
in many Asian restaurants shops and

456
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,160
temples many people assume that this

457
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,760
figure is a representation of the

458
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,080
historical Buddha sidartha

459
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,160
gotama however this is actually a common

460
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,039
misconception the figure depicted in

461
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,039
these statues is actually a Chinese

462
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:01,559
Buddhist monk named budai or Pai

463
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:03,559
he is said to have lived during the 10th

464
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:06,280
Century in China and is revered as a

465
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:09,159
manifestation of the future Buddha

466
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,200
mraa according to Legend budai was known

467
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:13,960
for his jovial nature his love of

468
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,000
children and his wandering lifestyle he

469
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,159
would often carry a large sack filled

470
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,320
with gifts and Candy which he would

471
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:23,520
distribute to children and the needy his

472
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,600
rotund figure and smiling countenance

473
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,400
are seen as symbols of Happiness

474
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,320
contentment and

475
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,640
generosity in Chinese culture Buddha is

476
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,720
often referred to as the Laughing Buddha

477
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,080
and is associated with Good Fortune

478
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,120
abundance and the blessings of

479
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,240
children statues and images of budai are

480
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,240
often found in homes businesses and

481
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,240
temples as a symbol of good luck and

482
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,400
prosperity it's important to note that

483
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,720
while buddai is a revered figure in

484
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,120
Chinese Buddhism he is not the same as

485
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,240
the historical Buddha sidhartha Gama the

486
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,000
Buddha who lived in India around the

487
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:03,120
fifth century BCE is typically depicted

488
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,080
as a slender Serene figure with a more

489
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,200
austere and contemplative expression the

490
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,320
confusion between Buddha and the Buddha

491
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,159
is understandable given their shared

492
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,919
association with Buddhism and their

493
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:17,679
similar appearance as bald smiling

494
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:19,960
figures however it's important to

495
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,159
recognize the distinct identities and

496
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,039
roles of these two figures within the

497
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:25,240
Buddhist

498
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,440
tradition by understanding the true

499
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,240
identity and significance of Buddha we

500
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,880
can appreciate the diversity and

501
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,240
richness of Buddhist iconography and

502
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,610
avoid perpetuating common misconceptions

503
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,799
about this ancient and complex

504
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:43,080
[Music]

505
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,320
tradition many people assume that the

506
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,039
Dalai Lama is the Buddhist equivalent of

507
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,960
the Pope serving as the supreme leader

508
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:52,080
and Authority for all Buddhists

509
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,679
worldwide while the Dalai Lama is

510
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,120
certainly a highly respected and

511
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,400
influential figure particularly within

512
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,880
Tibetan Buddhism his role and author

513
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,360
are quite different from that of the

514
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,559
Pope in

515
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:08,039
Catholicism firstly it's important to

516
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:10,679
understand that the Dalai Lama is

517
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:13,520
primarily a leader within the gug school

518
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,880
of Tibetan Buddhism he is considered to

519
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,320
be the Reincarnation of a long line of

520
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,120
spiritual teachers and is revered as a

521
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,720
manifestation of

522
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,120
avalokitesvara the bodhisatwa of

523
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,159
compassion however the Dalai Lama's

524
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,000
Authority is not universally recognized

525
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:31,039
by all Buddhists

526
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,360
other schools of Tibetan Buddhism such

527
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,080
as the nyingma kagu and sakya have their

528
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,159
own spiritual leaders and lineage

529
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,760
holders and may not necessarily look to

530
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:43,640
the Dalai Lama for guidance or

531
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:46,080
leadership moreover outside of Tibetan

532
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,600
Buddhism the Dalai Lama has no formal

533
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,559
Authority or leadership role while he is

534
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,080
certainly respected and admired by many

535
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,080
Buddhists around the world for his

536
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,360
wisdom compassion and tireless advocacy

537
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,640
for peace and human rights he is not

538
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,159
considered to be the leader or

539
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,600
spokesperson for all of Buddhism in fact

540
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,679
one of the key differences between

541
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,520
Buddhism and Catholicism is that

542
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,919
Buddhism does not have a single

543
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,279
centralized Authority or

544
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,000
hierarchy each school and lineage of

545
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:17,159
Buddhism has its own teaches texts and

546
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,720
practices and there's no one figure or

547
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,120
institution that holds sway over the

548
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,840
entire

549
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,159
tradition the Buddha himself incouraged

550
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,520
his followers to rely on their own

551
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,480
direct experience and discernment rather

552
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,480
than blindly following any external

553
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,000
Authority including

554
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:36,679
himself he emphasized the importance of

555
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,720
individual inquiry critical thinking and

556
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:41,799
self-reliance on the path to

557
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,600
Awakening so while the Dalai Lama is

558
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:45,240
certainly a revered and influential

559
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,640
figure within Tibetan Buddhism and

560
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,880
Beyond it's important to recognize the

561
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,520
diversity and decentralization of

562
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,840
authority within the Buddhist tradition

563
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,640
as a whole by appreciating the unique

564
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,400
roles and contributions of the many

565
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,559
different teachers lineages and schools

566
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,760
within Buddhism we can gain a more

567
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:07,080
nuanced and authentic understanding of

568
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,080
this rich and complex

569
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,880
tradition many believe Buddhism is a

570
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,919
single homogeneous tradition with a

571
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,360
unified set of beliefs and practices in

572

complex religion with many different

574

schools lineages and

575
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,799
traditions over the centuries as

576
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,000
Buddhism spread from its origins in

577
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:35,120
India to other parts of Asia and Beyond

578
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,480
it adapted to local cultures and

579
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,200
developed unique expressions in each new

580
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,200
context today there are many different

581
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,799
forms of Buddhism each with its own

582
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,799
distinct teachings practices and

583
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,880
cultural

584
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,919
influences the two main branches of

Buddhism are theravada and Mahayana

586
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,440
theava which is primarily practiced in

587
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,240
Southeast Asian countries like Sri Lanka

individual liberation and the attainment

590
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,720
of Nirvana through strict adherence to

591
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,000
the Buddha's original

592
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,679
teachings Mahayana on the other hand

593
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,440
which is more prevalent in East Asian

594
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,520
countries like China Japan and Korea

595
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,919
emphasizes the bodhisatwa path and the

596
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,880
goal of liberating all beings from

597
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:20,760
suffering Within These two main branches

598
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,000
there are many Subs schools and lineages

599
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,840
each with its own unique emphases and

600
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,760
practices for example within Mahayana

601
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,600
Buddhism there are schools like Zen pure

602
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,480
land and vajana each with its own

603
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,120
distinct approach to meditation devotion

604
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,159
and ritual even within a single school

605
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,039
or lineage there can be significant

606
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,559
diversity and debate around key points

607
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:44,320
of Doctrine and practice Buddhist

608
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,480
Scholars and practitioners have engaged

609
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,400
in Lively discussions and debates

610
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,000
throughout history and there is no

611
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,279
single Authority or text that is

612
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,720
universally accepted by all

613
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:57,320
Buddhists despite this diversity however

614
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,600
there are certain core teachings and

615
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,919
values that are shared by most Buddhist

616
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,559
Traditions these include the four noble

617
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,200
truths the eight-fold path and the

618
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,520
cultivation of wisdom and compassion

619
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,720
while the specific methods and

620
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,360
approaches may vary the ultimate goal of

621
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,760
Buddhism is the same to realize the true

622
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,400
nature of reality and to find lasting

623
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,880
happiness and freedom from suffering so

624
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,760
while it's important to recognize the

625
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,840
diversity and complexity of the Buddhist

626
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,880
tradition it's also important to

627
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,000
appreciate the underlying unity and

628
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,360
coherence of its core teachings

629
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,559
by exploring the many different

630
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,679
expressions of Buddhism with an open and

631
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,360
curious mind we can gain a richer and

632
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,740
more nuanced understanding of this

633
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,769
ancient and enduring

634
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,769
[Music]

635
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,039
tradition the final misconception will

636
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,679
address today is the idea that all

637
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:49,559
Buddhists believe in

638
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,360
reincarnation while the concept of

639
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:53,360
rebirth is certainly a central teaching

640
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,320
in many Buddhist Traditions it's

641
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,039
important to understand that not all

642
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,640
Buddhists interpret or emphasize this

643
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,919
idea in the same way

644
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,000
in traditional Buddhist cosmology the

645
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,679
process of rebirth is seen as a natural

646
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,279
consequence of the law of cause and

647
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,440
effect or

648
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,399
Karma according to this view the actions

649
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,880
and intentions of an individual in one

650
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:17,880
lifetime can shape the circumstances of

651
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,760
their future lives leading to a cycle of

652
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:23,640
existence characterized by suffering and

653
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,760
dissatisfaction the ultimate goal of

654
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,840
Buddhist practice then is to break free

655
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,080
from this cycle of rebirth and to attain

656
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,200
a state of Liberation or Enlightenment

657
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,240
known as

658
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,320
Nirvana this is achieved through the

659
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,520
cultivation of wisdom compassion and

660
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,360
mindfulness and the realization of the

661
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,840
true nature of

662
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,200
reality however it's important to note

663
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,480
that the idea of rebirth is interpreted

664
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,520
differently by different Buddhist

665
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,679
schools and

666
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,200
individuals some Buddhists understand

667
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,760
rebirth as a literal process involving

668
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,120
the transmigration of a solar

669
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,600
Consciousness from one physical body to

670
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,279
another others interpret rebirth in a

671
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,120
more metaphorical or psychological sense

672
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,360
as a way of describing the continuity of

673
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,720
mental habits and tendencies from one

674
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,240
moment to the next moreover some Modern

675
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,960
Buddhists particularly in the west may

676
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,679
not emphasize the idea of rebirth at all

677
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,880
choosing instead to focus on the

678
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,919
Practical benefits of Buddhist teachings

679
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,799
and practices in this lifetime for these

680
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,520
individuals the ultimate goal of

681
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,760
Buddhist practice may be seen more in

682
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,960
terms of personal transformation

683
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,080
emotional well-being and and social

684
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,159
engagement rather than escape from the

685
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,960
cycle of

686
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,640
rebirth ultimately while the concept of

687
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,919
rebirth is certainly a significant

688
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,960
aspect of traditional Buddhist teachings

689
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:42,640
it is not the only or even the most

690
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,080
important element of Buddhist thought

691
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,159
and practice by recognizing the

692
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,480
diversity of views and approaches within

693
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,399
the Buddhist tradition we can appreciate

694
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,039

695
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:56,120
ancient wisdom tradition and find ways

696

to apply its insights and practices in

697
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:01,279
our own lives regardless of our Bel

698
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,279
beliefs about the

699
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,760
