1
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,208
picture this

2
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:12,125
medieval Europe 1099

3
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,916
Christian knights storm Jerusalem's walls shouting

4
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:17,708
god wills it blood flows through streets

5
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:19,416
as citizens fall to the sword

6
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,208
meanwhile in ancient Asia

7
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,416
Buddhist monks walked from village to village

8
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,208
with nothing but robes and a bowl

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,041
they didn't conquer they didn't convert

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,541
they just listened

11
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,833
in one part of the world

12
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,375
men slaughtered each other shouting

13
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,708
god wills it in another

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,208
men sat in silence

15
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,666
conquering nothing but their own minds

16
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,083
why this stark difference

17
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,333
why did Christianity Islam

18
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,750
and other religions raise armies for their gods

19
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,750
while Buddhism spread across continents

20
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,416
without a single holy war

21
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:57,625
Buddhism operates differently

22
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,166
from belief based religions

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,583
it offers a testable system for understanding your mind

24
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,541
this distinction matters

25
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:07,166
when we talk about why people fight holy wars

26
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,000
before we dive deeper a quick note

27
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,500
this video explores

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
historical patterns of religious spread

29
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,375
and violence

30
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:18,875
my intention isn't to criticize any faith tradition

31
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:19,833
but to understand

32
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:22,291
Buddhism's unique approach to sharing ideas

33
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,208
every tradition contains both peaceful

34
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:28,208
and violent elements I'm simply examining why

35
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,750
Buddhism's spread followed a distinctive pattern

36
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,250
armies empires

37
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,041
and kings

38
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:37,833
embraced Buddhist teachings and put down their swords

39
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,458
not because someone forced them to

40
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,500
but because the logic was just that convincing

41
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,500
and when I tell you about the bloodthirsty emperor

42
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,291
who killed 99% of his family to gain power

43
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,958
but then became Buddhism's greatest champion

44
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,208
you'll understand why

45
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,291
this system of thought never needed holy wars

46
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,708
to become a global force

47
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,041
but here's the twist

48
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,500
there are Buddhist extremists today

49
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,375
so what went wrong

50
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,083
this is the untold story of how ideas

51
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,625
not armies conquered half the world

52
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,083
Buddhism doesn't fit neatly into western categories

53
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,791
this distinction matters

54
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,333
especially when we talk about holy wars

55
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,375
we might argue Buddhism had no holy wars

56
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,958
because it's not really a religion

57
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,000
but this misses the point

58
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,583
Buddhism has all the elements

59
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,041
we associate with religion

60
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,958
monks temples

61
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,833
rituals scriptures

62
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:37,166
cosmology and supernatural elements like rebirth

63
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,458
millions of people worship the Buddha

64
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,416
and pray to bodhisattvas for assistance

65
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,291
no the absence of Buddhist holy wars

66
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,375
can't be explained away

67
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,666
that simply there's something deeper at work

68
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,458
what's fascinating

69
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,708
is that the Buddha never intended to start a religion

70
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:53,500
at all

71
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,583
when asked if his was the only path to liberation

72
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,000
he responded with the parable of the raft

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,500
his revolutionary point spiritual teachings

74
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,750
are tools for crossing the river of suffering

75
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,458
not dogmas to be defended

76
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,666
the Buddha said do not believe anything

77
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,250
simply because you have heard it

78
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,666
or because it is written in your religious books

79
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,208
but after observation and analysis

80
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,666
when you find that anything agrees with reason

81
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,500
and is conducive to good

82
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,458
then accept it and live up to it

83
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,583
this differs radically from traditions

84
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,000
where questioning core beliefs

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,458
might be considered heresy

86
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:39,958
when

87
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,625
you don't need others to accept your claims on faith

88
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,875
you don't need to force them to believe

89
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,083
compare this to Christianity spread through Europe

90
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,791
while Christianity

91
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,708
initially expanded through persuasion

92
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,250
during Roman persecution

93
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,958
after Constantine's conversion in 312 CE

94
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:01,625
imperial power became a primary vehicle for its growth

95
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,708
by the late 4th century

96
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,458
Christian emperors were outlawing pagan practices

97
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,833
and destroying temples

98
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,958
similarly Islam's early expansion

99
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,416
combined preaching with military conquest

100
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,375
creating vast empires

101
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,375
where non Muslims paid special taxes

102
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,083
and faced various restrictions

103
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,666
Buddhism's different approach

104
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,875
emphasizing personal verification over belief

105
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,083
created fundamentally different patterns of expansion

106
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,083
throughout history

107
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,166
religious conflicts have shaped our world

108
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,250
burning through civilizations

109
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,625
redrawing borders and claiming countless lives

110
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,708
the Crusades stand as perhaps the most famous example

111
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,416
Pope Urban

112
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,500
II launched the First Crusade in 1095

113
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,583
with a simple call god wills it

114
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,125
Christian knights

115
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,083
marched thousands of miles to reclaim Jerusalem

116
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,291
from Muslim rule

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,375
when they finally breached Jerusalem's walls in 1099

118
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,416
the Crusaders slaughtered Muslims

119
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,958
Jews and even eastern Christians

120
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,833
one crusader Raymond of Aguilers wrote

121
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,125
in the temple of Solomon

122
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,958
men rode in blood up to their knees in bridle reins

123
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,625
but Christianity holds no monopoly on holy wars

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,166
Islamic expansion brought its own religious conflicts

125
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,250
the concept of jihad

126
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,708
though primarily meaning spiritual struggle

127
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,166
also justified military campaigns

128
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,125
early caliphates expanded rapidly across North Africa

129
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,708
the Middle Eastern parts of Europe

130
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:41,000
converting populations and establishing Islamic rule

131
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,708
in Europe the Thirty Years War

132
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:49,375
1618 to 1648 pitted Catholics against Protestants

133
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,875
in a devastating conflict

134
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,750
that killed nearly a third of Germany's population

135
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,958
all because they interpreted the same holy book

136
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:57,791
differently

137
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,041
even Hinduism often portrayed as peaceful

138
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,208
has its warriors

139
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,458
the Mahabharata describes a righteous war

140
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,291
where the god Krishna tells the warrior Arjuna

141
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,791
if you will not fight this righteous war

142
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,541
then you will fail in your duty

143
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,000
lose your reputation and incur sin

144
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,500
so what drives people to kill in the name of god

145
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,291
the human toll of these conflicts is staggering

146
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,916
the Crusades killed perhaps

147
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,708
1 to 3 million people over two centuries

148
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,166
the 30 years War caused around 8 million deaths

149
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,250
the Pakistani Indian partition in 1947

150
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,333
driven partly by religious differences

151
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:40,583
displaced 14 million people and killed up to 2 million

152
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,208
religious wars typically share key ingredients

153
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,458
exclusive truth claims divine authorization

154
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,041
and cosmic dualism

155
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,291
dividing the world into forces of good and evil

156
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,416
religious warriors don't see themselves as killers

157
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,208
but as saviors they're not conquering

158
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,500
they're liberating they're not murdering

159
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,416
they're saving souls

160
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,250
holy wars aren't just about territory or resources

161
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,708
they're existential battles for cosmic order

162
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,458
the stakes couldn't be higher

163
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,625
eternal salvation or damnation

164
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,833
so how did Buddhism avoid this pattern

165
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:17,916
let's examine how

166
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,250
Buddhism's unique approach to truth and practice

167
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,833
made it fundamentally different

168
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,500
at Buddhism's core lies ahimsa non violence

169
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,625
not just a nice suggestion

170
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,416
but a fundamental principle

171
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,208
the very first precept that every Buddhist accepts is

172
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,125
I undertake the training rule to abstain from killing

173
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,708
this isn't just about avoiding murder

174
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,666
it extends to daily choices about causing harm

175
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,291
a monk carefully watches his step

176
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,750
to avoid crushing insects

177
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,500
a Buddhist lay person

178
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,875
considers how their consumption affects other beings

179
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,708
this comprehensive approach to nonviolence

180
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,750
permeates every aspect of life

181
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,333
according to Buddhist teachings

182
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,250
all beings tremble before danger

183
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,041
all fear death when a man considers this

184
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,125
he does not kill or cause to kill

185
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,750
the Buddha rejected violence even in his own life

186
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,541
born Prince Siddhartha

187
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,041
he abandoned the warrior caste and military training

188
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,250
that was his birthright

189
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,833
when his own clan faced annihilation

190
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,333
he attempted to prevent the slaughter

191
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,750
through peaceful intervention

192
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,541
standing between opposing armies

193
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,000
what makes Buddhism different

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,541
is its relationship to truth and conversion

195
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,041
while most religions operate on faith and revelations

196
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:37,125
Buddhism operates on testing hypotheses about suffering

197
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,833
the Buddha claimed his teachings came from

198
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,333
direct observation of how the mind works

199
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,208
as the Buddha expressed it

200
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,750
just as the wise test gold by burning

201
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,083
cutting and rubbing it

202
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,666
so are you to test my words by examining them

203
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,541
Buddhism also introduced concepts like emptiness

204
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,000
sunyata not nothingness

205
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,125
but the understanding that nothing exists

206
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,000
independently or permanently

207
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,833
imagine a wooden table

208
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,541
is it really a table or is it wood

209
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,083
which came from a tree which came from soil

210
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,291
sunlight and water

211
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,916
everything is interconnected with no separate

212
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,125
permanent self

213
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,791
this realization dissolves

214
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,208
the very logic that fuels religious conflict

215
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,458
if there's no permanent self to defend

216
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,000
and no essential difference between us and them

217
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,250
what exactly are we fighting for

218
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,833
but could such simple principles

219
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,541
non violence and inquiry

220
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,833
truly transform the heart of a killer

221
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,000
and change the fate of an empire

222
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,958
history provides us a stunning answer

223
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,208
in the form of one of humanity's most dramatic

224
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,166
transformations

225
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,458
to appreciate Ashoka's transformation

226
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,166
understand the man he was before Buddhism

227
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,083
court chronicles describe him as Chandashoka

228
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,625
Ashoka the cruel for good reason

229
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,833
he reportedly burned enemies alive

230
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,416
built a torture chamber called Ashoka's Hell

231
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,875
and eliminated 99 of his brothers to secure the throne

232
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,375
his armies were feared across the subcontinent

233
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,500
for their brutality

234
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,875
eight years into his reign

235
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,875
Ashoka launched his most ambitious conquest yet

236
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,416
against Kalinga

237
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,333
a prosperous independent kingdom in eastern India

238
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,458
The Kalinga War was particularly savage

239
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,541
Ashoka's own edicts record 150,000 people were deported

240
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:36,041
100,000 were killed and many more died

241
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:40,041
imagine the scene fields of corpses

242
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,750
villages burning families torn apart

243
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,458
all to satisfy one man's imperial ambition

244
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,500
then something remarkable happened

245
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,875
as Ashoka toured the battlefield afterward

246
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,166
the sight of corpses scattered across the land

247
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,291
the wailing of widows and orphans

248
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,166
the devastation of a once thriving region

249
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,875
it broke something in the Conqueror

250
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,000
standing amid the carnage he'd created

251
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,791
this ruthless emperor faced the ultimate question

252
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,291
was this power or merely destruction

253
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,541
in his own words carved into rock for posterity

254
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,166
after the Kalinga War the beloved of the gods

255
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,583
Ashoka began to follow Dharma

256
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,916
to love dharma and to give instruction

257
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,625
in dharma now the beloved of the gods

258
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,375
feels remorse for having conquered Kalinga

259
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,291
this remorse wasn't just a passing emotion

260
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,833
it triggered the most dramatic

261
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,791
royal transformation in history

262
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,375
Ashoka embraced Buddhism

263
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,916
and completely reversed his imperial policy

264
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,791
he abandoned conquest

265
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,416
and dedicated his reign to spreading

266
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,708
Buddhist principles through non

267
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,625
violent means instead of sending armies

268
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,666
he sent monks instead of building fortresses

269
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,000
he built hospitals

270
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,666
instead of imposing military rule

271
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,333
he carved ethical principles into stone pillars

272
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,041
across his vast empire

273
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:04,208
the Ashoka pillars and rock edicts still visible today

274
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,500
proclaimed revolutionary ideas

275
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:11,333
one edict stated all religions should reside everywhere

276
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,791
for all of them desire self control and purity of heart

277
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,500
this might be the earliest declaration

278
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,541
of religious tolerance by a major ruler in history

279
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,541
Ashoka demonstrated that Buddhist principles

280
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,666
could transform not just individuals

281
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,125
but entire empires

282
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,166
and he created a model for how Buddhism could spread

283
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,083
through ethical example rather than military might

284
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,416
Ashoka's conversion showed Buddhism could transform

285
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,125
even the most violent ruler

286
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,833
but can a philosophy spread across continents

287
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,541
without armies carrying it

288
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,791
the answer lies in how Buddhism traveled

289
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,416
the ancient highways of commerce

290
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,166
while many religions followed the sword

291
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,791
Buddhism followed the merchant's caravan

292
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,750
trade routes became Buddhism's superhighways

293
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,875
especially the vast network we now call the Silk Road

294
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,958
connecting China to Central Asia

295
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,166
India the Middle East and eventually Europe

296
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,666
let me take you to Dunhuang

297
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,041
China around the year 600 CE

298
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,000
a weary merchant caravan arrives at the oasis

299
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,416
after weeks crossing the Taklamakan Desert

300
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,000
their camels laden with silk and spices

301
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,583
destined for Persia the desert crossing has been brutal

302
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:25,666
sandstorms

303
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,791
bandits and the constant threat of death by thirst

304
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,958
but here at the edge of China

305
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,833
something remarkable greets them

306
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,875
a complex of caves carved into cliff faces

307
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,458
inside

308
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,500
magnificent Buddha statues reach toward the ceiling

309
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,500
walls covered in vibrant paintings

310
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,083
depicting the Buddha's life

311
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,541
the travelers find not just shelter

312
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,458
but a place to deposit valuables

313
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,750
exchange currency receive medical care

314
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,291
and restore their spirits

315
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,125
before the next leg of their journey

316
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,416
a local monk approaches the lead merchant

317
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,541
offering tea they share no common language

318
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,916
yet through translation

319
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,166
the merchant hears teachings that make sense to him

320
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,291
regardless of his culture or background

321
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,666
the focus on ethical business practices

322
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,958
on reducing suffering on finding inner peace

323
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,875
amid the chaos of desert crossings

324
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,958
this speaks to his daily reality

325
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,916
before departing the merchant leaves

326
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,750
a generous donation to expand the cave complex

327
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,875
ensuring future travelers will find the same refuge

328
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,833
scenes like this played out again and again

329
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,291
across Asia's trade routes

330
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
as historian Jerry Bentley noted

331
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,791
Buddhism traveled the Silk Roads

332
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,000
in the wallets and saddle bags of merchants

333
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,708
not on the backs of warriors

334
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,166
Buddhism offered practical benefits

335
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,541
for traveling merchants its emphasis on ethical conduct

336
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,750
created trust between trading partners

337
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,208
its monastery networks provided safe places to rest

338
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,916
store goods and exchange currency

339
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,833
and its universal principles

340
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,083
worked across different cultures

341
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,000
and languages

342
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,166
Buddhism also excelled at cultural adaptation

343
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,250
unlike religions that demanded exclusive allegiance

344
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,166
Buddhism allowed practitioners to maintain

345
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,750
local customs alongside Buddhist practice

346
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,708
the Buddhist concept of upaya

347
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:16,958
or skillful means gave missionaries flexibility

348
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,375
they could present Buddhism differently

349
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,708
depending on the audience

350
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,000
emphasizing philosophical aspects for the educated

351
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,791
meditation for the spiritually inclined

352
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,958
ethical teachings for rulers

353
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,875
and devotional practices for common people

354
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,958
Buddhism's journey along trade routes

355
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,916
demonstrates how ideas can spread without conquest

356
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,916
but what happened when those ideas

357
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,750
encountered established religions

358
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,000
and deeply rooted belief systems

359
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,333
the story of these encounters

360
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,666
reveals Buddhism's unique flexibility

361
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,916
when Buddhism encountered other belief systems

362
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,750
it typically sought harmony rather than conflict

363
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,458
but the outcomes varied dramatically

364
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,833
Buddhism's encounter with Islam proved more complex

365
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,583
and sometimes tragic Arab armies

366
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,708
conquering Central Asia

367
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,416
in the 7th and 8th centuries

368
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,916
encountered flourishing Buddhist civilizations

369
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,333
monasteries crumbled libraries burned

370
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,708
the magnificent Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan

371
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,541
destroyed by the Taliban in 2001

372
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,666
were first damaged during these early Muslim conquests

373
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,500
why did Buddhism disappear from these regions

374
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,375
not because Buddhists fought and lost holy wars

375
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,250
but because Buddhist institutions

376
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,333
couldn't survive without royal patronage

377
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,041
the new Islamic rulers

378
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,708
naturally favored their own faith

379
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,208
throughout Southeast Asia

380
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,916
a different story unfolded

381
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,333
when Buddhism met indigenous animist traditions

382
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,333
and Hinduism remarkable synthesis occurred

383
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,666
Thai monks perform ceremonies honoring local spirits

384
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:58,000
in Myanmar Nat worship continues alongside Buddhism

385
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,833
on islands like Java and Bali

386
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,000
Hindu and Buddhist elements blend seamlessly

387
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:08,583
in China Buddhism encountered Confucianism and Taoism

388
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,500
two sophisticated philosophical systems

389
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,583
deeply embedded in Chinese culture

390
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,500
Buddhist missionaries responded not with force

391
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,083
but with skilled translation

392
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,625
they used Taoist terms to explain Buddhist concepts

393
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,666
making ideas like emptiness

394
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:24,833
sunyata

395
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,958
accessible through comparison with Taoist non action

396
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:28,750
Wu Wei

397
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,833
the result was a fascinating philosophical dialogue

398
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,250
Buddhism influenced Chinese thought

399
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,416
while being transformed into distinctively

400
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,708
Chinese schools like Chan Zen

401
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,250
Buddhism's journey to the west

402
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,458
represents another fascinating chapter

403
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,791
when Buddhist texts first reached Europe

404
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,666
in the 19th century they influenced philosophers

405
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,500
like Schopenhauer and Nietzsche

406
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,000
unlike earlier religious encounters

407
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,833
Buddhism entered western consciousness

408
00:17:56,833 --> 00:18:00,125
primarily as philosophy rather than competing religion

409
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,916
in the 20th century figures like Alan Watts

410
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,041
DT Suzuki

411
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:05,541
and later

412
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:09,000
the Dalai Lama presented Buddhism to western audiences

413
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,791
not as a conversion target

414
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,875
but as a complementary practice

415
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,375
many Westerners today practice Buddhist meditation

416
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,708
while maintaining their original religious identity

417
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,291
a pattern of adoption rather than conversion

418
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,791
that mirrors Buddhism's historical spread in Asia

419
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,625
this pattern of adaptation rather than confrontation

420
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,791
characterized Buddhism spread

421
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,208
it preferred dialogue over debate

422
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:36,125
inclusion over exclusion and synthesis over conquest

423
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,041
but this peaceful history

424
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,125
makes the exceptions all the more jarring

425
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,583
because there have been cases

426
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,333
where Buddhism has been linked to violence

427
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:47,041
and extremism cases we need to examine honestly

428
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,375
if Buddhism promotes non violence so strongly

429
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,500
how do we explain Buddhist monks

430
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,333
calling for violence against Muslims

431
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,416
in Myanmar

432
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,666
or Sri Lankan Buddhists attacking Tamil Hindus

433
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,458
now to be clear

434
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,250
these violent voices do not represent all of Buddhism

435
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,916
far from it

436
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,041
across the world most Buddhist monks

437
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,333
teachers and practitioners

438
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,291
remain deeply committed to compassion

439
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,000
peace and non harming

440
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,000
what we're examining here is how any tradition

441
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,541
no matter how peaceful

442
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,208
can be distorted when it becomes fused with fear

443
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,500
power or nationalism

444
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,208
let's start with Myanmar

445
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,166
where nationalist Buddhist monks led by Ashin Wirathu

446
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,458
have fueled violence against Rohingya Muslims

447
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:35,916
Wirathu

448
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,416
once called the Buddhist bin Laden by time magazine

449
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:43,583
founded the 9 6 9 movement to boycott Muslim businesses

450
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,000
his inflammatory speeches

451
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,125
characterize Islam

452
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,250
as an existential threat to Buddhism

453
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,625
his rhetoric helped spark violence

454
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,791
that forced over 700,000 Rohingya to flee Myanmar

455
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:58,416
since 2017 in what the UN has described as

456
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,958
a textbook example of ethnic cleansing

457
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,541
these monks didn't chant for peace

458
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:07,083
they chanted for purity they didn't disarm delusion

459
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,375
they re armed it

460
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,500
they didn't follow the Buddha's path of non attachment

461
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,000
they clung desperately to nationalism

462
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,000
they didn't seek to end suffering they perpetuated it

463
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,500
this isn't Buddhism as the Buddha taught it

464
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,875
it's Buddhism hijacked by the very forces

465
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,166
it was designed to overcome fear

466
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,541
attachment and delusion

467
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,583
when Buddhist nationalists claim

468
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,041
Buddhism will disappear if we don't defend it

469
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,208
they directly contradict the Buddha's teaching

470
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,958
that hatred does not cease by hatred

471
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,375
but only by love

472
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
this is an eternal rule as the Dalai Lama said

473
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,416
regarding Myanmar Buddha would have definitely

474
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,083
helped the Rohingya Muslims

475
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,750
he would not discriminate

476
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,083
these cases of Buddhist nationalism can't be understood

477
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,625
without colonial context

478
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,250
Myanmar and Sri Lanka experienced British colonization

479
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,958
that privileged certain ethnic groups

480
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,375
and religions over others

481
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,666
creating lasting social divisions

482
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,333
Japanese militarism emerged as a response to western

483
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,208
imperial dominance in Asia

484
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,333
colonial powers often used religious differences

485
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,250
to implement divide and rule strategies

486
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,333
hardening boundaries between groups

487
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,000
that had previously coexisted

488
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,625
when these countries gained independence

489
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,416
religious nationalism became a way to assert

490
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,333
post colonial identity

491
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,166
against perceived foreign threats

492
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,083
the exceptions we examined Myanmar

493
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,125
Sri Lanka wartime Japan

494
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,500
all involved Buddhism

495
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,583
becoming entangled with nationalism

496
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,833
this fusion of religious and national identity

497
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,625
creates a dangerous dynamic

498
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,833
a perceived threat to the nation

499
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,750
becomes a threat to religion

500
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,375
and vice versa

501
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:51,833
these exceptions

502
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,291
don't disprove Buddhism's peaceful track record

503
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,375
they highlight what happens when any belief system

504
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,833
even one founded on non violence

505
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,041
becomes entangled with nationalism

506
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,625
and identity politics

507
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,500
the Buddha's teachings

508
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,000
included a built in solution to such distortions

509
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,750
the practice of meditation itself

510
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,791
which creates internal conditions for peace

511
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,458
while other religions pray for peace

512
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,583
Buddhists train their minds for it

513
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,375
this isn't just spiritual talk

514
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,291
it's practical psychology backed by modern science

515
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:30,958
at Buddhism's core lies a simple but profound insight

516
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:35,500
violence begins in the mind with thoughts of anger

517
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,125
hatred and division so peace must begin there too

518
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:41,958
in the Buddha's words

519
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,416
all that we are arises with our thoughts

520
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:47,375
with our thoughts we make the world

521
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,916
let's try a brief experiment right now

522
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,916
just for 20 seconds notice your breathing

523
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,875
feel the sensation of air

524
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,666
entering and leaving your nostrils

525
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,500
when your mind wanders

526
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,166
and it will gently bring it back to your breath

527
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:16,333
that pause

528
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:21,583
that was a seed of peace in that space no war can grow

529
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,750
what you just experienced

530
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,958
is the foundation of Buddhist meditation

531
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:29,500
creating awareness of your mental processes

532
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:30,791
now imagine

533
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:33,708
extending this ability to moments when anger arises

534
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:37,375
you'd notice the anger but wouldn't be controlled by it

535
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,416
this simple practice

536
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,583
scaled across millions of practitioners

537
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,125
creates a fundamentally

538
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,708
different relationship to conflict

539
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:45,625
than faith's focus

540
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,083
primarily on belief

541
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:48,833
Buddhist meditation

542
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,291
directly addresses the root causes of aggression

543
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,750
it doesn't just tell you to be peaceful

544
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,333
it trains your brain to

545
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,000
respond differently to provocations

546
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,333
modern neuroscience echoes what monks intuited

547
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,541
centuries ago

548
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:04,333
regular meditation physically changes the brain

549
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,875
in ways that reduce aggression

550
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:09,250
neuroscientists at the university of Wisconsin

551
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,041
measured brain activity in experienced meditators

552
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,291
they found increased activity

553
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:17,000
in areas associated with positive emotions

554
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:20,000
and reduced activity in aggression related areas

555
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:24,166
even in war zones meditation creates islands of peace

556
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,833
during Cambodia's bloody civil war

557
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,458
monk Maha Ghosananda

558
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,958
led peace walks through active combat areas

559
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,041
teaching meditation to villagers

560
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,250
caught in the crossfire

561
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:37,000
one refugee described the impact

562
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:38,625
before meditation

563
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:41,208
when I thought of the Khmer Rouge killing my family

564
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:44,625
I wanted to take revenge after meditation

565
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,625
I still see my family killed

566
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,500
but I don't feel the same hatred

567
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,250
this transformation

568
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,791
from vengeful victim to peaceful survivor

569
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:57,000
represents Buddhism's most profound gift to humanity

570
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:58,666
not just a philosophy

571
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:02,125
but a practical path from hatred to healing

572
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,583
this built in technology for peace

573
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,125
gives Buddhism a unique advantage

574
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,375
in preventing violence

575
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:09,791
it doesn't just prohibit aggression

576
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,500
it systematically uproots its psychological causes

577
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:21,291
after thousands of years through empires and upheavals

578
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,125
Buddhism spread without swords

579
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:26,708
but what can this ancient strategy teach us now

580
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:29,125
in a world still addicted to conflict

581
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:30,458
first

582
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:33,041
ideas spread better through attraction than coercion

583
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:35,958
Buddhism didn't conquer half of Asia with armies

584
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,500
it won hearts and minds by addressing real

585
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,625
human suffering

586
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,000
second

587
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,875
Buddhism shows the power of adapting to local cultures

588
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,000
without compromising core principles

589
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:48,500
Buddhism didn't demand that Chinese

590
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,916
people stop being Chinese

591
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:52,333
or Tibetans abandon their cultural identity

592
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:53,500
it offered tools

593
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,458
that could work within existing frameworks

594
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:59,500
third Buddhism demonstrates that focusing on practice

595
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,666
rather than belief creates more stable foundations

596
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:06,541
instead of demanding allegiance to unprovable claims

597
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,708
Buddhism offers techniques

598
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:11,000
you can verify through personal experience

599
00:26:11,916 --> 00:26:13,833
fourth Buddhism reveals

600
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:16,083
the danger of mixing spiritual traditions

601
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:17,583
with national identity

602
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:21,208
when spiritual practices become markers of national

603
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:22,583
or ethnic identity

604
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:25,750
the universal message gets corrupted into an us

605
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,750
versus them mentality

606
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,791
fifth Buddhism shows how internal transformation

607
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,250
precedes external peace

608
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:35,041
the Buddhist approach

609
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:37,125
recognizes that social change begins

610
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,208
with individual minds now

611
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:41,666
imagine if the world's most entrenched conflicts

612
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,791
were approached not with flags or faith

613
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:45,708
but with one guiding question

614
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:47,500
how do we reduce suffering

615
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:51,458
of course these conflicts are incredibly complex

616
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,458
rooted in history identity

617
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,750
trauma and pain on all sides

618
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,500
we're not here to take political stances

619
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,208
or simplify them but from a Buddhist lens

620
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:04,000
we can ask how might a different kind of thinking

621
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:05,875
focused on reducing suffering

622
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,583
rather than proving who's right

623
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,125
shift the conversation

624
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,708
take for instance

625
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,833
the longstanding conflict between Israelis

626
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,875
and Palestinians both sides claim exclusive

627
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,625
divine rights to the same land

628
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,458
what if instead

629
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:21,208
they followed the Buddha's approach of non

630
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:22,375
attachment to views

631
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,291
what if they prioritized reducing suffering

632
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,708
over establishing who has the right claim

633
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,041
or consider Ukraine and Russia

634
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:32,083
a conflict partly fueled by competing

635
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,208
historical narratives and identity claims

636
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:36,791
a Buddhist approach would ask

637
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:39,541
how can we minimize suffering right now

638
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:42,708
rather than who is historically right

639
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,500
perhaps most importantly

640
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,041
Buddhism demonstrates that peace isn't just a goal

641
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,458
it's a strategy

642
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,333
the Buddha taught that means and ends are inseparable

643
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,750
peaceful ends require peaceful means

644
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,375
violent methods

645
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,958
inevitably corrupt even the noblest objectives

646
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:00,041
in a world

647
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:02,791
still torn by religious and ideological conflicts

648
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:04,500
Buddhism's peaceful spread

649
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,375
reminds us that the most powerful revolutions begin

650
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:10,041
not with swords but with insights

651
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,583
ideas once carried in begging bowls

652
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:17,000
now shape entire nations not by force but by awakening

653
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:21,958
now

654
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:24,166
that you've seen how Buddhism spread across continents

655
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:25,291
without holy wars

656
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:28,041
I invite you to experiment with these principles

657
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:31,750
in your own life try a simple 5 minute meditation

658
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,333
notice how your mind works when you're angry

659
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:37,458
see if creating space between emotion and action

660
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,791
changes your responses to daily frustrations

661
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,125
you don't need to become Buddhist

662
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:43,791
to benefit from these insights

663
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:46,250
the Buddha's approach to peace works

664
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,791
regardless of your beliefs

665

do you see parallels between Buddhist spread

673
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,000
and other peaceful movements
