1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,166
in the royal court of ancient India

2
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:12,666
a scene unfolds that Buddha would never forget

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
four visitors approach the king

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,208
each bearing a different mask of friendship

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,208
the first arrives with gifts and honeyed word

6
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,583
his charm masking his true intentions

7
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,000
the second speaks of grand visions and mighty deeds

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,416
but his hands have never known the weight of work

9
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,541
the third bows deeply a childhood friend of the court

10
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,500
his familiar smile hiding a dagger meant for backs

11
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,000
and the fourth

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,958
the fourth comes with gentle hands and kind excuses

13
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,500
leading souls down sweet scented paths to ruin

14
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,291
Buddha watching from the shadow

15
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,875
sees through all their masks

16
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,541
and today his warning echoes through time

17
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,458
about these four types of people

18
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,083
who can destroy your life

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,958
2,500 years ago in the royal court of Kosala

20
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,958
during a time when India was undergoing massive

21
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,166
social and philosophical changes

22
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,708
Buddha did something remarkable

23
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,250
cities were growing

24
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,458
and creating new forms of relationships

25
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:13,458
beyond traditional family and tribal bonds

26
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,791
merchants were rising to power

27
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,083
challenging traditional social hierarchies

28
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,000
in this complex social landscape

29
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,416
people needed guidance more than ever

30
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,125
that's when Buddha

31
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,833
observing the intricate politics of royal courts

32
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,791
and the emerging merchant class

33
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,041
did something extraordinary

34
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,958
he created what might be the world's first

35
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:39,208
psychological profile of toxic relationships

36
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,458
long before modern psychology

37
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:41,750
Buddha

38
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,583
identified specific patterns of harmful behavior

39
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,666
that are shockingly relevant today

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,375
these aren't just ancient warnings

41
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,041
there are precise descriptions of people we

42
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,750
encounter in our modern lives

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,375
in our workplaces on social media

44
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,875
and sometimes even in our inner circles

45
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,000
together they form what Buddha called

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,958
the four hindrances of fellowship

47
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,416
relationships that seem supportive

48
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,500
but actually impede our growth

49
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,083
what makes Buddha's insight so powerful

50
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:15,083
is that he didn't just point out these harmful types

51
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,666
he explained exactly how they operate

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,250
why they're dangerous and most importantly

53
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,000
how to protect ourselves from their influence

54
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,583
in the next 20 minutes

55
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,958
we'll decode Buddha's original teachings

56
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,041
about these four types of people

57
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,750
we'll examine ancient Buddhist texts

58
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,458
look at fascinating historical examples

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,666
and reveal

60
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:41,625
how these same patterns play out in our modern world

61
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,625
but I need to warn you this knowledge might change how

62
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,458
you see some people in your life

63
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,250
because once you understand these patterns

64
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,041
you'll start recognizing them everywhere

65
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,833
let's begin with the first type

66
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,208
the one Buddha called Mitta-patirūpaka

67
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,916
the person who wears the mask of friendship

68
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:05,250
imagine

69
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,333
walking through the bustling streets of ancient

70
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,500
Rajagaha the market is alive with traders

71
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,041
but among them walks a different kind of merchant

72
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:17,750
one who trades not in goods but in promises and praise

73
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,541
the Buddha called these people Mitta-patirūpaka

74
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,875
those who wear the mask of friendship

75
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,208
and in the Sigalovada Sutta

76
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,958
he revealed exactly how to spot them

77
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:33,125
remember this truth sweet words may fill the ears

78
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,125
but empty hands tell the truth

79
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,541
in the Sigalovada Sutta

80
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,541
Buddha taught the one who takes much and gives little

81
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,416
who performs duties only out of fear

82
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,875
who associates for their own advantage

83
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:49,958
rather than from love know them to be Mitta-patirūpaka

84
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,291
a false friend this teaching

85
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,083
preserved in the Pali Canon for over two millennia

86
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,750
reveals exactly how to spot them

87
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,125
think of a traitor named Ananda

88
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,416
not the Buddha's disciple

89
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:06,416
but a wealthy merchant who once lived in Rajagaha

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,500
his warehouse is overflowed with silk

91
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,000
spices and precious gems

92
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,125
but what he valued most was his reputation

93
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,541
for being a generous and trusting man

94
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,208
one day a charismatic stranger appeared at his door

95
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,583
this man spoke of grand trading ventures

96
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,041
of doubling Ananda's wealth

97
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,041
his words sparkled like jewels

98
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,166
his manners were impeccable

99
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,583
he knew exactly what to say

100
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,583
exactly how to bow

101
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,125
exactly when to laugh

102
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,250
other merchants warned Ananda

103
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,291
something feels wrong they said

104
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,333
but the stranger had an answer for everything

105
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,041
he even donated generously to the local monastery

106
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,583
but only when others were watching

107
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,791
Buddha who was staying at the Bamboo Grove Monastery

108
00:04:58,791 --> 00:04:59,458
at that time

109
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,500
noticed something peculiar about this man's behavior

110
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,750
he pointed out four distinct patterns

111
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,916
that revealed his true nature

112
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,041
first the man only gave

113
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,583
when he expected something greater in return

114
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,500
his generosity was like a fishing hook

115
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,833
baited with small gifts to catch bigger prizes

116
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:23,333
second his kind words far outweighed his kind actions

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
he spoke endlessly of future riches

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,458
but always had excuses for why his previous promises

119
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,083
hadn't materialized

120
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,333
third he flattered Ananda

121
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,375
constantly praising his wisdom and generosity

122
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,708
especially when others were listening

123
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,333
but when Ananda needed actual help

124
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,041
this man was mysteriously absent

125
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,791
fourth and most telling

126
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,916
he began isolating Ananda from his true friends

127
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,916
they're jealous of our success

128
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:52,958
he would say

129
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,625
they don't understand our vision

130
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,250
Buddha explained that these four behaviors

131
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,708
taking much while giving little

132
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,958
empty promises flattery without substance

133
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,708
and creating division

134
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:10,166
are the hallmarks of what he called false friends

135
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,333
the story of Ananda reaches its climax

136
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,625
when the stranger finally makes his move

137
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,500
he proposes a massive trade venture

138
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,625
one that would require Ananda

139
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,875
to liquidate most of his wealth

140
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,666
trust me he says

141
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,750
this opportunity won't come again

142
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:28,541
but by then

143
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,541
Ananda had begun to see the pattern Buddha described

144
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,166
he noticed how his so called friends

145
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,083
generosity had dried up once he gained influence

146
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:42,375
how his grand promises remained just that promises

147
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,916
the teachings about Mitta-patirūpaka

148
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,458
saved Anandas fortune

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,375
but more importantly

150
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,291
they revealed a profound truth about human nature

151
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,458
that's just as relevant today

152
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,416
think about it we've all

153
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,041
encountered modern versions of the sweet talker

154
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,916
they're in our workplaces

155
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:07,791
on social media sometimes even in our closest circles

156
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,166
they're the influencer promising quick wealth

157
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,208
the colleague who's suspiciously friendly

158
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,000
before asking for favors

159
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,000
the friend who's generous only when others are watching

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,416
but here's what makes Buddha's insight truly remarkable

161
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,583
he understood that these people aren't always

162
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,375
consciously deceptive

163
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:31,708
sometimes they fooled even themselves

164
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,541
in the Dhammapada

165
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,416
Buddha explains that our minds naturally seek pleasure

166
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,625
and avoid pain

167
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,083
some people learn to manipulate this tendency

168
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:40,958
in others

169
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,791
becoming expert at providing momentary pleasure

170
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,500
through sweet words and empty promises

171
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,958
the real danger isn't just financial loss or betrayal

172
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,666
it's the erosion of our ability to trust

173
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,000
to form genuine connections

174
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,041
each encounter with a Mitta-patirūpaka

175
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,291
leaves a scar on our capacity

176
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,166
for authentic relationships

177
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:02,625
but

178
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,375
Buddha didn't share these insights to make us paranoid

179
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,541
instead he gave us tools for discernment

180
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,666
he taught that true friendship

181
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:13,875
unlike its counterfeit grows stronger with time

182
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,250
real friends remain consistent

183
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,208
whether anyone's watching or not

184
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,833
while the sweet talker actively deceives

185
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,958
through false generosity our next type

186
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,333
operates through a different kind of deception

187
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,125
one of empty words and hollow promises

188
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,625
Buddha called them Vācāya Parama

189
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,833
and their danger lies not in what they do

190
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,416
but in what they consistently fail to do

191
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,000
and unlike our previous type

192
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,250
you might be dealing with one right now

193
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,000
without even realizing it

194
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,166
the empty promiser or as Buddha called them

195
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,500
Vācāya Parama

196
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,875
speaks grand words but lacks the substance of action

197
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,791
and this type hits differently in our modern world

198
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,208
here's what you need to know

199
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,708
the loudest promises often have the quietest results

200
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,333
imagine this scene from Buddha's time

201
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,250
a young monk proudly declares to the entire monastery

202
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,791
that he'll reach enlightenment within a month

203
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,666
he speaks eloquently about his dedication

204
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:20,541
his unshakeable resolve the other monks are impressed

205
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:24,250
days pass than weeks this monk spends more time talking

206
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,708
about meditation than actually meditating

207
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,166
when challenges arise

208
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,000
he has endless explanations

209
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,333
but no real progress

210
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,958
Buddha used this moment to teach a crucial lesson

211
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,625
he said empty words are like beautiful flowers

212
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,500
without fragrance they might catch your eye

213
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,500
but they lack the essence of what they promise

214
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,541
in ancient times these types were common

215
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,583
in royal courts they'd promise military victories

216
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:57,000
bountiful harvests or diplomatic triumphs

217
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,416
their words were like honey

218
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,750
but their hands remained empty

219
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,083
today we see them everywhere

220
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,791
they're the perpetual planners who never execute

221
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,666
the ones who make passionate pledges at every meeting

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,458
but deliver nothing

223
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:15,041
the friend who's always about to change their life

224
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,333
but here's what makes Buddha's teaching about

225
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,875
empty promises truly profound

226
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,333
he didn't just identify them as people

227
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,916
who fail to keep promises

228
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,250
he understood they often believe their own words

229
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,708
in the Anguttara Nikaya Buddha explains that

230
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:31,666
some people mistake

231
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,625
the pleasure of talking about goals

232
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,875
for the satisfaction of achieving them

233
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,916
they become intoxicated with their own rhetoric

234
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,083
let me share a lesser known story

235
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,750
about how Buddha handled one of these types

236
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,458
during a severe drought in Kosala

237
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,166
food became scarce people were desperate

238
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,166
that's when a man stepped forward in the town square

239
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,958
he claimed to know secret rituals that could bring rain

240
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,375
his speeches drew crowds people clung to his every word

241
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,250
day after day he described elaborate ceremonies

242
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,916
and complex predictions

243
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,916
he spoke of his deep connection with weather spirits

244
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,291
of signs only he could read

245
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,708
the townspeople gave him food

246
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,541
shelter even precious offerings

247
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,250
but no rain fell when questioned

248
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,250
he always had a new explanation

249
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,875
a new ceremony a new promise

250
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,500
each failure became an opportunity

251
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,375
for an even grander pledge

252
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,166
Buddha who was staying nearby

253
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,791
used the situation to teach about the danger

254
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:36,750
of empty promisers he explained that their true harm

255
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,083
isn't just in their broken promises

256
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,250
it's in the way

257
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,500
they rob people of the energy to find real solutions

258
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,458
while the town focused on the rainmakers empty words

259
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,791
they ignored practical solutions

260
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,083
fields went untended

261
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,791
water conservation efforts were delayed

262
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,750
real opportunities slipped away

263
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,333
this pattern repeats today

264
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,458
think about the colleague

265
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,000
who's always talking about revolutionary ideas

266
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,541
but never implements them

267
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:08,625
or the friend

268
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,208
who repeatedly promises to change their life

269
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,625
but only collects self help books

270
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,375
Buddha identified four specific

271
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,083
signs of the empty promiser

272
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,666
first they focus on past accomplishments

273
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,250
to avoid present action second

274
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,750
they make future promises

275
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,083
to escape current responsibilities

276
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:28,333
third

277
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,833
they complicate simple tasks with unnecessary planning

278
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,208
fourth when confronted with failure

279
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,625
they respond with even bigger promises

280
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,083
but here's the crucial insight

281
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:39,916
Buddha taught that

282
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,833
empty promisers often suffer more than their victims

283
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,375
they live in a world of perpetual almost achievement

284
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:47,958
never experiencing

285
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,625
the genuine satisfaction of real accomplishment

286
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,708
this brings us to our third type

287
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,458
perhaps the most dangerous of all

288
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,666
the secret enemy

289
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,791
unlike the sweet talker or empty promiser

290
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,000
this person hides their true nature

291
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,375
behind a mask of genuine concern

292
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,333
the secret enemy Pāpamitta in Buddha's teachings

293
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,375
is like a weapon wrapped in silk

294
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,958
their danger lies not in what they show

295
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,958
but in what they hide

296
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,416
keep this wisdom close not all smiles hide teeth

297
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,458
but all teeth hide behind smiles

298
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,958
there's a chilling story from Buddha's time

299
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,250
about a merchant's son named Vedika

300
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,291
he had a close friend

301
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,750
someone he'd known since childhood

302
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,583
they played together studied together

303
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,625
shared every secret

304
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,458
this friend attended every family Celebration

305
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,708
knew every detail of Vedika's life

306
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,333
and always seemed to be there in times of need

307
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:52,000
but beneath this perfect friendship lay a darker truth

308
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,708
you see while Vedika's business flourished

309
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,291
his friends ventures failed one after another

310
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,291
each failure fed a growing resentment

311
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,083
each of Vedika's successes became a personal wound

312
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,416
this friend did something Buddha warn

313
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,708
specifically about

314
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:11,041
he began using his intimate knowledge not to help

315
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,666
but to harm

316
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:18,541
a whispered word here a subtle suggestion there

317
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,500
like poison in a cup of wine

318
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,916
the damage was invisible until it was too late

319
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,875
he knew Vedika's trade roots

320
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,458
his business partners his family secrets

321
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,791
he knew exactly where to plant seeds of doubt

322
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,041
exactly which relationships to strain

323
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,458
precisely how to turn allies into enemies

324
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,791
Buddha explained

325
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,125
that the Pāpamitta is particularly dangerous

326
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,541
because they weaponize trust itself

327
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,041
this connects directly to the Buddhist concept of karma

328
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,625
not just as cause and effect

329
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,791
but as intentional action

330
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,750
the secret enemy creates negative karma in two ways

331
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,791
through their harmful intentions

332
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:02,708
cetanā

333
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,291
and through causing others to develop mistrust

334
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,583
which leads to suffering dukkha

335
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,333
their actions violate the core Buddhist principle of

336
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,000
ahimsa non harming

337
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,291
while disguising themselves as friendship

338
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,333
they don't attack from outside they destroy from within

339
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,083
in the Anguttara Nikaya

340
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,083
Buddha described four signs that reveal a secret enemy

341
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,416
they celebrate your failures privately

342
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,083
while mourning them publicly

343
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,375
they minimize your successes

344
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,458
often with subtle criticism disguised as concern

345
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,708
they share your secrets with others

346
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,916
while swearing everyone else to secrecy

347
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,375
they study your weaknesses

348
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,458
not to help but to exploit

349
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,166
but here's where the story takes an unexpected turn

350
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,666
when Vedika finally discovered the truth

351
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,666
his first reaction wasn't anger

352
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,500
it was crushing guilt

353
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,000
guilt over not seeing what was happening

354
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,833
guilt over trusting too deeply

355
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,291
Buddha saw him in this state

356
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,083
and shared a teaching that would change his life

357
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,041
the secret enemy Buddha explains

358
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,750
succeeds not through their own power

359
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,875
but through our blindness to their nature

360
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,458
they're like termites in a wooden pillar

361
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,458
the damage isn't visible

362
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,083
until the structure is ready to collapse

363
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,375
in Vedika's case the truth emerged

364
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,666
when his friend made a crucial mistake

365
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,250
during a business negotiation

366
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,208
he accidentally revealed knowledge

367
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,500
he couldn't have known

368
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,500
unless he'd been secretly undermining deals

369
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,750
the mask slipped just for a moment

370
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,666
today secret enemies operate in more sophisticated ways

371
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,333
they're the colleague who forwards your private emails

372
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,333
with concerned comments the friend

373
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,083
who shares your confidential struggles with others

374
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,666
just to get advice

375
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,541
the family member

376
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,500
who remembers every mistake you've made

377
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,666
and brings them up at crucial moments

378
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:58,750
but Buddha's teaching

379
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,291
went deeper than just identifying these people

380
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,000
he explained why they become secret enemies

381
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,666
often they're wounded people

382
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,333
who've convinced themselves

383
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,375
that their actions are justified

384
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,250
their resentment has twisted their perception so much

385
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,583
that they see their betrayal as fairness

386
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,583
this understanding leads us to something profound

387
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,500
the secret enemy's greatest weapon

388
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,875
isn't their knowledge of our weaknesses

389
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:28,000
it's their ability to make us doubt ourselves

390
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,416
to make us question our own judgment

391
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,041
which brings us to our fourth and final type

392
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,041
the enabler

393
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,041
unlike the previous three

394
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,500
this person doesn't mean to cause harm

395
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,208
but as Buddha taught

396
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,208
good intentions don't prevent real damage

397
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,875
the enabler Apāyasahāya

398
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:51,958
in Buddha's word

399
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,791
might be the most relevant type in our modern world

400
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,166
they're not malicious like the secret enemy

401
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,583
deceptive like the sweet talker

402
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,291
or hollow like the empty promiser

403
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,708
their danger lies in a different kind of poison

404
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,791
the poison of comfortable decline

405
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,500
remember this pattern

406
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,333
comfort in decline is still decline

407
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,750
let me share a story Buddha told about a young monk

408
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,166
named Channa unlike most cautionary tales

409
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,291
Channa wasn't a bad person

410
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,875
in fact he was known for his kindness

411
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:32,250
his generosity his willingness to support others

412
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,291
but Channa had friends who encouraged his every weakness

413
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,541
when he skipped meditation to sleep late

414
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,291
they'd say you needed the rest

415
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,583
when he broke his precepts

416
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,958
they'd say you're only human

417
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,583
when he neglected his duties

418
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,583
they'd say

419
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,958
you work too hard anyway

420
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,000
these friends meant well they cared about Channa

421
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,541
they wanted him to be happy

422
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,500
but as Buddha pointed out

423
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,333
they were leading

424
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,833
him down a path of spiritual destruction

425
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,125
Buddha compared these enablers to friends

426
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,625
who would help you drink poison

427
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,708
because they didn't want to upset you by saying no

428
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,958
their kindness becomes a curse

429
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,625
in the monastery

430
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,083
something fascinating happened with Channa

431
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,000
the more his friends supported his weaknesses

432
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,125
the more those weaknesses grew

433
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,750
his small lapses became habits

434
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,250
his occasional breaks became permanent departures

435
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:33,833
his minor excuses became fixed justifications

436
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,458
Buddha identified four ways enablers harm us

437
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,708
they support us in neglecting our duties

438
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,500
they encourage us to justify our mistakes

439
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,083
they help us avoid necessary challenges

440
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,708
they make decline feel like comfort

441
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,083
here's the most striking part of Buddha's teaching

442
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,291
about enablers

443
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,208
they often appear as our most supportive friends

444
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,416
they're the ones who always agree with us

445
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,125
who never challenge us

446
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,083
who make us feel good about staying exactly where we

447
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:02,916
are

448
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,541
in Channa's case

449
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,208
his wake up call came during a powerful storm

450
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,166
while other monks maintained their practice

451
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,958
despite the harsh conditions

452
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,250
he sought comfort with his enabling friends

453
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,708
that night Buddha asked him a question

454
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,958
that cut through all his justifications

455
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,500
is the path to enlightenment meant to be comfortable

456
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:25,625
or true

457
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,750
today enablers are everywhere

458
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,166
they're the friends who encourage us to skip work

459
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,750
when we're just lazy

460
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,208
not sick

461
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,458
the family members who support our unhealthy habits

462
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,666
because they don't want to see a struggle

463
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,750
the social media groups

464
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,875
that validate our worst impulses

465
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:48,250
because of self care sounds better than self discipline

466
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,083
but Buddha's insight about enablers

467
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,041
reveal something profound about human nature

468
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,916
it is easier to stay comfortable in decline

469
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,583
than to embrace the discomfort of growth

470
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,416
we seek out people who will support our weaknesses

471
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,916
rather than challenge us to overcome them

472
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,791
this brings us full circle

473
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,583
these four types the sweet talker

474
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,583
the empty promiser the secret enemy and the enabler

475
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,291
aren't just ancient categories

476
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,208
they're patterns of human behavior

477
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,791
that repeat through history

478
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:20,416
but

479
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,208
Buddha didn't share these warnings to make us paranoid

480
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,500
or distrustful

481
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,041
he gave us this knowledge for a specific purpose

482
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,083
to help us cultivate genuine

483
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,750
healthy relationships

484
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,208
true friends Buddha taught

485
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,083
are like stars in the night sky

486
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,791
they don't just shine when we look at them

487
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,916
they don't hide their light

488
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,208
they don't lead us astray

489
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,333
and most importantly

490
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,375
they help us navigate toward our true north

491
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,875
the question isn't whether we'll

492
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,291
encounter these four types

493
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,875
we will the question is

494
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,500
whether we'll have the wisdom to recognize them

495
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,416
the courage to address them

496
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,583
and the strength to choose better relationships

497
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,375
because in the end

498
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,125
the company we keep shapes the person we become

499
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,000
Buddha's wisdom on these four types

500
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,125
was never meant to create

501
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,708
fear or suspicion it was meant to cultivate wisdom

502
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,000
in the Mangala Sutta

503
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,291
Buddha taught that choosing our relationships wisely is

504
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,375
the greatest blessing not wealth

505
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:24,833
not fame

506
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,708
but the simple act of surrounding ourselves with true

507
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:31,541
friends look around your life right now

508
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,958
in your workplace and in your social circles

509
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,166
in your closest relationships

510
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,291
the sweet talkers who charm but never deliver

511
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,166
the empty promisers who speak but never act

512
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:45,541
the secret enemies who smile but harbor darkness

513
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:49,541
the enablers who comfort but prevent growth

514
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,041
Buddha's teaching

515
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,875
offers three powerful steps for transformation

516
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,958
first watch the patterns

517
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,125
not the promises

518
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:00,416
true friends reveal themselves through consistent

519
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,791
actions not occasional words

520
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:06,583
as Buddha said like gold tested in fire

521
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:09,625
the faithful reveal themselves in times of trouble

522
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,958
second cultivate discernment

523
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:15,708
not suspicion this isn't about becoming paranoid

524
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:20,833
it's about becoming wise wisdom arises from meditation

525
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:24,125
without meditation wisdom declines

526
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,458
knowing this two way path for gain and loss

527
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,708
conduct yourself to increase wisdom

528
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:34,208
and finally choose growth over comfort

529
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:37,000
the path to any worthy goal runs through discomfort

530
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,416
true friends won't just support you

531
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,541
they'll challenge you to become better

532
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,291
before you leave today

533
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,708
I have one question for you to contemplate

534
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:50,625
a question Buddha often asked his disciples

535
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:54,500
if the company you keep doesn't lead you toward wisdom

536
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,500
compassion and truth where exactly is it leading you

537
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,750
take this moment right now

538
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,125
to think about one relationship in your life

539
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:08,416
that lifts you higher that challenges you to grow

540
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,500
that brings out your best self

541
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:11,916
send them this video

542
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:14,208
as a thank you for being a true friend

543
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:15,916

next week we'll explore the 5 types of true friends

547
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:28,208
Buddha said everyone needs in their life

548
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:30,750
until then remember his words

549
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,958
the wise grow in the company of the wise

550
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:35,833
stay mindful stay wise
