1
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:08,833
3:00am phone glowing

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
you know you should sleep

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,750
but the scroll just won't stop

4
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,833
does it ever feel like something else is controlling

5
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,666
you pulling you deeper

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,166
there's a name for this in Buddhism

7
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:23,375
a hungry ghost a spirit trapped in endless craving

8
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,833
imagine a being forever thirsty but never satisfied

9
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:31,000
driven mad by desire sound familiar?

10
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,000
keep watching there's a way out

11
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:37,250
I know that late night screen lit feeling all too well

12
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:10,250
a few months ago

13
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,000
I was right there endlessly scrolling at 3 am

14
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,500
feeling hollow but unable to stop

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,958
that's when Buddha's ancient wisdom hit me

16
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,583
in a way I never expected

17
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,958
in a previous video we ventured through

18
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,833
the chilling realms of Buddhist hells

19
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,750
but there's another realm closer to us

20
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,000
a realm of hungry ghosts

21
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,291
unlike the demons of hell

22
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:36,208
these ghosts aren't locked away somewhere distant

23
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,875
they're already here hiding in our habits

24
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,083
haunting our minds

25
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:41,708
like a hungry ghost

26
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:44,833
the untrained mind is never satisfied with what it has

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,625
these aren't just ancient words

28
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,208
this is your Instagram feed at midnight

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,375
your TikTok binges your endless YouTube rabbit holes

30
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:56,000
imagine

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,750
being cursed with a hunger that can never be satisfied

32
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,625
a throat too small to swallow

33
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,333
a stomach too big to fill

34
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,625
an endless craving that drives you mad

35
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,041
this is what Buddha called tanha

36
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,208
a thirst that can never be quenched

37
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,750
a cycle of wanting more

38
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,625
sound like fantasy look around

39
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,583
see that person who can't stop shopping

40
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:16,541
the one obsessed

41
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:20,625
with likes you right now unable to put down your phone

42
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,208
you're experiencing one of Buddhism's three poisons

43
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,416
greed or as I like to call it

44
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,708
the ghost of endless craving

45
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,750
I'm Matt from Buddha's Wisdom

46
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,541
where we turn ancient Buddhist teachings

47
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,708
into powerful tools for modern life

48
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,333
this Halloween special

49
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,458
reveals the truth about hungry ghosts

50
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,208
how to spot them in your daily life

51
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,958
and the shocking ways they're controlling you

52
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:44,791
right now

53
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:49,791
plus a powerful story of a monk who found the way out

54
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,541
your phone's glowing your ghost is hungry

55
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,125
ready to break free?

56
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,916
now forget everything you know about ghosts

57
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,666
these aren't your sheet wearing

58
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,500
chain rattling Halloween specials

59
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,750
these are the beings Buddha warned us about

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,875
creatures trapped in a reality of their own cravings

61
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:11,166
remember my 3:00am scrolling confession

62
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,833
that night changed everything

63
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,625
because while staring at that endless feed

64
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,791
Buddha's words echoed in my mind

65
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:29,041
imagine this a being with a body the size of a house

66
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,750
but a neck thinner than a needle

67
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,583
always starving never satisfied

68
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,708
even if they find an entire ocean of water

69
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,416
it turns to fire the moment it touches their lips

70
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:43,166
in Buddhism this isn't just a spooky story

71
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,875
it's one of the six realms we can be reborn into

72
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,916
if we let our cravings control us

73
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:49,958
but here's the plot twist

74
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,416
and I learned this during my retreat in Thailand

75
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,000
you

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,541
don't need to die to experience the hungry ghost realm

77
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,833
those hunger pangs they're happening right now

78
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,375
that endless TikTok scroll

79
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,833
that's the poison of greed

80
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,625
those three a m Instagram stories

81
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,166
that's tanha endless thirst

82
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,625
that Netflix autoplay you can't resist

83
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,000
that's the hungry ghost of entertainment

84
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,208
that gaming achievement you can't stop grinding for

85
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,750
pure ghost energy

86
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
those shopping apps you check every hour

87
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,416
the ghost of materialism

88
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,083
let me share something personal

89
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,958
last year I spent a lot of money on in app purchases

90
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,875
games upgrades

91
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,208
premium features

92
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,541
trying to fill a void that kept getting bigger

93
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,166
Buddha called this the cycle of craving

94
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,208
the more you feed it the hungrier it gets

95
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,125
ancient Buddhist art shows these creatures

96
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,375
with bulging bellies and tiny mouths

97
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,166
today that's your phone

98
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,875
infinite content but no amount feels like enough

99
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,333
these ghosts are trapped in a nightmare buffet

100
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,666
surrounded by everything they want

101
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,541
but unable to enjoy any of it

102
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,500
sound familiar? let's get personal for a second

103
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,583
look at your screen time right now

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,250
go ahead I'll wait

105
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:10,958
shocking isn't it?

106
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,375
when I first checked mine

107
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,916
it was 9 hours

108
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,291
that's not just FOMO or bad habits

109
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,500
that's your hungry ghost mode activated

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,333
the average person spends 7 hours on their phone daily

111
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,791
that's 7 hours of feeding a ghost that never gets full

112
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,250
7 hours of chasing likes views

113
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,500
and notifications

114
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,833
that leave you feeling emptier than before

115
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:37,833
as Buddha said

116
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,125
think about your last social media binge

117
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,958
remember that hollow feeling

118
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,583
after two hours of scrolling

119
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,958
that's not just boredom

120
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,625
that's your hungry ghost throwing a tantrum

121
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,791
because no matter how much content it consumes

122
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,833
it's still starving but before you panic

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,583
there's something

124
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,583
you need to understand about these ghosts

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,916
something I discovered

126
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,250
after that brutal wake up call in Thailand

127
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:04,416
something that could flip

128
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,500
your whole digital life upside down

129
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,916
let's get real about these ghost symptoms

130
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,500
Buddha talked about 3 poisons that trap us in suffering

131
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,250
today these poisons

132
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,500
show up as different types of digital hunger

133
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,958
and trust me I've experienced all of them

134
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,708
first up physical hunger

135
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,791
your Uber Eats history looks like a novel

136
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,416
your pantry is full but nothing feels right

137
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,625
late night snacks become a ritual

138
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,250
during my first meditation retreat

139
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,250
my teacher said something that hit home

140
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,500
you're not feeding your body

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,875
you're feeding a ghost that's hijacked your cravings

142
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,791
next level emotional hunger

143
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,166
1000 matches on dating apps

144
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,916
zero real connections 500 friends on Facebook

145
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,250
nobody to call at 3:00am perfect Instagram feed

146
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,250
empty DMS Buddha nailed it 2500 years ago

147
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,500
yet here we are swiping for validation

148
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,375
let me share something uncomfortable

149
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,750
few years ago

150
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,541
I was spending 6 hours a day on dating apps

151
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,291
six hours of swiping right on strangers

152
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,208
while ignoring real connections

153
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,416
classic hungry ghost behavior

154
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,875
but wait it gets deeper

155
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,750
mental hunger Buddha called it the monkey mind

156
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,666
always jumping from branch to branch

157
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,500
never satisfied sound familiar?

158
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,708
YouTube suggests the video you click

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,416
three hours later you're watching

160
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,166
conspiracy theories about underwater basket weaving

161
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,458
Netflix asks "still watching?" your ghost

162
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,250
hits yes before you can blink

163
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,916
remember that Thailand retreat I mentioned?

164
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,958
no phones allowed first 3 days felt like withdrawal

165
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,250
because it was

166
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,083
the 3 poisons were detoxing from my system

167
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,416
the scariest part these ghosts team up

168
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,458
that's right

169
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,916
while you're doom scrolling with a midnight snack

170
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,500
listening to a podcast

171
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,750
all three hungers are feeding at once

172
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,083
in Buddhist terms

173
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,375
you're not just visiting the hungry ghost realm

174
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,375
you're building a vacation home there

175
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,041
try putting down your phone for an hour

176
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,875
feel that itch that anxiety

177
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,666
that FOMO creeping in that's not you

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,166
that's your ghost throwing a tantrum

179
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,958
and just when you think you've got it under control

180
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,291
these ghosts start running your entire schedule

181
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,458
remember my 3:00am story?

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,666
that was just the beginning

183
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,666
let me show you exactly how

184
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,958
these hungry ghosts hijack your day

185
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,333
time for some ghost hunting in your daily routine

186
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,416
Buddha taught

187
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,583
that awareness is the first step to freedom

188
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,583
after my retreat

189
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,333
I started tracking my own ghost moments

190
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,375
and trust me what I discovered changed everything

191
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,416
morning ghost your alarm rings

192
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,125
but before your feet hit the floor

193
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,875
your hands already grabbed your phone

194
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,708
fun fact monks wake up at 4:00am

195
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,500
and their first action is taking three mindful breaths

196
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,500
us? Instagram email TikTok

197
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,333
Facebook Twitter

198
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,916
every app gets checked not because you need to

199
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,333
but because your ghost is already starving

200
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,541
Buddha's words hit different

201
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,791
when you realize you're becoming

202
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,125
your notifications

203
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,250
work ghost that important deadlines coming up

204
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,958
but instead of focusing

205
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,166
you're checking crypto prices every five minutes

206
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,250
confession time

207
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,375
I once lost a writing gig

208
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,625
because I spent the whole day

209
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,708
checking my crypto portfolio

210
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,416
the three poisons in action

211
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,708
greed for gains hatred for losses

212
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,166
delusion about getting rich quick

213
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
lunch ghost

214
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,166
you order food take a photo

215
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,791
edit it post it

216
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,041
check likes recheck likes

217
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,000
forget to actually eat your food

218
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,166
meanwhile your ghost is feasting on validation

219
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,083
and your lunch is getting cold

220
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,291
Buddha taught mindful eating

221
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,291
we practice mindless posting

222
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,583
social ghost Friday night

223
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:33,916
you're out with friends

224
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,875
but your ghost keeps yanking

225
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,375
your attention to your pocket

226
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,708
remember my Thailand story

227
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,958
the most powerful moment wasn't the meditation

228
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:46,125
it was having actual conversations without phones

229
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:50,500
no likes no shares just presence

230
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,750
bedtime ghost

231
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,750
just one more video

232
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,000
one more episode

233
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,166
one more scroll

234
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,666
midnight passes 1:00am

235
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,250
2:00am in Buddhist monasteries

236
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,833
they say the hungry ghost realm is strongest at night

237
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,541
looking at our phone habits

238
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,125
they might be onto something

239
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,791
Weekend ghost two full days of freedom

240
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,125
perfect time to hit the gym

241
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,666
read that book start that project

242
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,166
instead

243
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,833
your ghost has other plans

244
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,958
before you know it you're 47 weeks deep in your ex's

245
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,958
new girlfriend's cousin's Instagram

246
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,541
as Buddha said

247
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,333
the most ruthless part

248
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,708
these ghosts are invisible to everyone else

249
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,291
nobody sees you checking your phone under the table

250
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,958
nobody knows about your 2:00am digital binges

251
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,916
nobody suspects you're possessed

252
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,041
but your screen time numbers

253
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,541
they tell a different story

254
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,708
just like my 9 hour wake up call

255
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,083
these numbers don't lie

256
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,875
and speaking of wake up calls

257
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,333
there's an ancient Buddhist story

258
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,208
that completely changed how I view digital addiction

259
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,833
you know what else doesn't lie?

260
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,583
ancient Buddhist wisdom

261
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,083
and there's one story that shook me harder than my own

262
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,791
3:00am rock bottom

263
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,875
Buddha taught this

264
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,041
but watch how it plays out in this story

265
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,458
Meet Maudgalyayana Buddha's most gifted disciple

266
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,208
think of him as

267
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,500
the ancient world's greatest Ghostbuster

268
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,583
during my time in Thailand

269
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,416
my teacher compared him to a spiritual superhero

270
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,291
he could read minds fly through walls

271
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,875
travel between realms

272
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,166
the spiritual equivalent of having every premium app

273
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:52,208
subscription blue check mark and viral post combined

274
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:53,916
but one day

275
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,416
he discovered something that shattered his world

276
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:00,375
his own mother reborn in the hungry ghost realm

277
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,583
let that sink in

278
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,666
the most connected person in the spiritual world

279
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,375
couldn't even help his own mom

280
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,000
every piece of food he manifested turned to fire

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,291
in her mouth every drop of water became acid

282
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,750
I remember sitting in meditation

283
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,250
thinking about my own mom's Facebook addiction

284
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,000
and this story hit differently

285
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,000
here was the most powerful monk in history

286
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,916
powerless to help his own mother

287
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,416
just like many of us feel powerless

288
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,791
watching our loved ones scroll their lives away

289
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,458
desperate he ran to Buddha

290
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,416
and here's where it gets real

291
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,166
Buddha dropped a truth bomb

292
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,333
that explains everything you're experiencing right now

293
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,250
the hungry ghost realm isn't just a place

294
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,041
it's a state of mind

295
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,666
one of the six realms we create with our own cravings

296
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,208
and no amount of power

297
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,041
money or followers can free you from it

298
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,625
the solution?

299
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,000
this is what blew my mind during a retreat

300
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,541
it wasn't meditation it wasn't prayers

301
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,541
it wasn't even Buddha's direct intervention

302
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,125
it was community connection

303
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,125
real human bonds Buddha taught

304
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,833
only when the entire Buddhist community came together

305
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,458
sharing their merit their positive actions

306
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,041
their genuine concern only then

307
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:31,083
was Maudgalyayana's mother freed from her ghostly prison

308
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,250
think about that the world's most powerful monk

309
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,125
couldn't save one person alone

310
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,500
but together they changed everything

311
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,291
just like my own journey

312
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,500
it wasn't an app or a hack that helped me break free

313
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,666
it was joining a meditation group

314
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,250
sharing struggles finding real connection

315
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,125
now look at your phone again

316
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,708
those notifications those likes

317
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,791
those followers are they filling your hunger?

318
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,416
or are they keeping you trapped?

319
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,000
like Maudgalyayana's mother

320
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
in an endless cycle of craving

321
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,583
but don't worry

322
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,875
just like Buddha showed Maudgalyayana the way out

323
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,791
I'm about to show you how to break free

324
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,333
breaking free from your hungry ghost

325
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,750
isn't about deleting all your apps

326
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,500
or throwing your phone into a river

327
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,791
Buddha never taught extreme measures

328
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,833
he taught the middle way during my retreat

329
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,416
I tried the whole digital detox thing

330
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,541
guess what happened when I got back

331
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,500
ghosts came back stronger

332
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,333
as Buddha said

333
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,666
so let's turn those ghost habits into good deeds

334
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,458
here's how first

335
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,541
build your ghost busting squad

336
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,750
remember Maudgalyayana story?

337
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,500
solo players lose this game

338
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,291
this hit home when I joined a meditation group

339
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:58,291
back home right now pause this video and text 3 friends

340
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,958
real friends not just Instagram mutuals

341
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,583
tell them you're forming a ghost busting squad

342
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,416
make plans real plans

343
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,916
not just virtual ones

344
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,750
my squad

345
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,791
we meet every Sunday no phones

346
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:14,875
just coffee

347
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,916
conversation and occasional crisis management

348
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,625
your ghost hates that stuff because it knows

349
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,750
community breaks the first poison

350
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,791
greed for digital validation

351
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,000
second the 2

352
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,125
minute ghost test

353
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,541
this comes straight from Buddhist mindfulness practice

354
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,916
before each action pause and reflect

355
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,708
every time you reach for your phone

356
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,166
give yourself 2 minutes just 2

357
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,500
ask yourself Buddha's 3 questions

358
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,166
sounds simple?

359
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,333
during my retreat

360
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,666
it took me 3 days to stop reaching for my phantom phone

361
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,000
your ghost will fight you on this one

362
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,625
because awareness breaks the second poison delusion

363
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,833
third the ultimate ghost repellant

364
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,583
here's what really scares hungry ghosts

365
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,875
generosity Dana

366
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,250
as Buddhists call it giving

367
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,208
sharing not just likes and reposts

368
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,666
real stuff help someone share knowledge

369
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,375
create something valuable

370
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,500
personal story time

371
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,166
I used to spend hours making perfect Instagram stories

372
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,500
now I spend that time creating videos like this one

373
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,083
same skills different purpose

374
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,166
ghosts can't stand genuine contribution

375
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,958
it breaks the 3rd poison

376
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,791
hatred or aversion to what's real

377
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,000
but here's the ninja move I learned from my teacher

378
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,541
turn your ghost habits into human habits

379
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,500
use that Instagram account to share real moments

380
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,125
not filtered facades

381
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,625
transform your YouTube binges into learning sessions

382
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,291
convert your Reddit scrolling into genuine

383
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,791
community participation

384
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,083
the secret? ghosts feed on isolation

385
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,833
they starve in connection

386
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,583
every real conversation every genuine laugh

387
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,208
every actual human moment weakens their grip

388
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,375
Buddha said it best

389
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,583
and those withdrawal symptoms

390
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,500
I mentioned earlier they're not permanent

391
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,625
I know because I've been there

392
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,833
your ghost will throw tantrums

393
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,375
it will beg for attention

394
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,375
it will promise that

395
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,833
the next scroll will finally satisfy you

396
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,708
but now you know better

397
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,666
because here's what Maudgalyayana really taught us

398
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,458
even the most powerful beings need a system

399
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,458
a protocol a way to maintain their freedom

400
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,083
and that's exactly what I'm about to show you

401
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,416
your ghost free power up protocol starts now

402
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,541
Buddha taught that liberation comes in stages

403
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,791
think of this as your spiritual video game

404
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,708
3 levels to break free from the hungry ghost realm

405
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,541
let me share something I learned the hard way

406
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,291
after Thailand I thought I was cured

407
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,500
then I downloaded TikTok game over

408
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,041
that's when my teacher shared Buddha's wisdom

409
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,458
small changes consistent practice

410
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,375
level 1 ghost tracking

411
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,000
know your enemy

412
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,916
Buddha taught your phone has a secret weapon

413
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,791
screen time stats but we're going deeper

414
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,500
track your ghost moments in real time

415
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,541
when do they appear? what triggers them?

416
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,416
my ghost it loves 4 pm

417
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,500
that post lunch pre evening slump

418
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,208
once I knew that I could prepare

419
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,166
now it's meditation time

420
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,083
your ghost hates being watched

421
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,166
because awareness is kryptonite to craving

422
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,041
level 2 freedom practices

423
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,916
remember the six realms we're aiming for

424
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:02,666
the human realm balanced, aware, present.

425
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,666
start small set up ghost free zones in your day

426
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,916
here's my routine learned from monks

427
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,000
first hour after waking sacred no phones

428
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,875
just breathing moving existing

429
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,000
your ghost will hate these zones at first good

430
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,250
as Buddha said

431
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,833
create a morning ritual that doesn't involve screens

432
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,500
could be meditation could be push ups

433
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,375
could be staring at clouds

434
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,375
I started with one minute of meditation

435
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,416
now 30 minutes feel short

436
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,500
what matters is

437
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,083
you're choosing reality over digital demons

438
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,666
level 3 the ultimate power move

439
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,541
this is where you become the ghost hunter

440
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,791
instead of the haunted

441
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,083
take those ghost triggering moments and flip them

442
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,583
social media craving

443
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,125
send a text to someone you haven't talked to in a while

444
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,416
YouTube spiral coming hit the gym instead

445
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:02,916
shopping urge

446
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,583
clean your room

447
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,000
remember Maudgalyayana?

448
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,875
his power came from helping others

449
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,375
that's your boss level

450
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,625
teaching others about their ghosts

451
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,750
because here's the wild thing

452
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,708
once you start seeing these patterns

453
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,333
you'll notice them everywhere

454
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,916
my proudest moment wasn't deleting social media

455
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,208
it was helping my mom

456
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,875
reduce her Facebook time from six hours to one

457
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,666
just like Maudgalyayana's community

458
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,333
we get stronger when we help others break free

459
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,458
your phone isn't cursed your apps aren't evil

460
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,833
as Buddha taught it's not the objects that bind us

461
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,333
but our attachment to them

462
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,250
your ghost it's counting on your unconscious patterns

463
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,416
to stay alive

464
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,791
but now you have the power to change the game

465
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,166
look at your phone right now

466
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,166
that glow isn't just blue light

467
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:53,791
it's your ghost spotlight

468
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:57,125
but after today you're seeing it differently aren't you

469
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,000
as Buddha said

470
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,458
maybe your ghost led you here for a reason

471
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
let me share one last personal story

472
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,375
remember that 3:00am scrolling moment I mentioned

473
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,875
that night I hit rock bottom

474
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,791
nine hours of screen time

475
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,791
zero real connections

476
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,833
but that moment of clarity

477
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,166
it changed everything just like 

478
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,208
Maudgalyayana found hope in community

479
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,666
I found mine right here with you

480
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,416
next time you catch yourself scrolling at 3:00am

481
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,000
you'll know what's really going on

482
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:35,750
when that notification itch hits

483
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,833
you'll recognize who's really scratching

484
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:40,666
that's not defeat that's awareness

485
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,250
and as Buddha taught

486
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,291
think about Maudgalyayana

487
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,083
even with all his supernatural abilities

488
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,500
he needed something more powerful than magic

489
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,666
he needed awareness connection

490
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,166
community

491
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:01,541
the same things we all need in this digital age

492
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,541
and that's exactly what we're building here

493
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:06,500
at Buddha's Wisdom a ghost busting community

494
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,541
a place where ancient wisdom meets modern life

495
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,833
where we transform hungry ghosts into

496
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:15,041
conscious creators here's your first power move

497
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,583
hit subscribe yeah

498
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:20,750
I know sounds ironic

499
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,916
but these aren't ghost feeds

500
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,666
these are your weekly reminders

501
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,791
to stay human in a digital world

502
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:30,125
turn on notifications plot twist

503
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,708
let's use the ghost's tools against it

504
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,541
drop a comment

505
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,791
what's your strongest ghost moment?

506
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,916
share it because somewhere out there

507
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,500
another viewer is fighting the same ghost

508
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,000
remember

509
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,958
Maudgalyayana's mother was freed through community action

510
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:49,208
your comment might be someone else's liberation

511
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,541
I'm Matt and remember

512
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,791
your ghost only has the power you give it

513
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:54,791
just like Buddha taught

514
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,208
see you in the next video

515
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:03,041
stay hungry for life not likes

516
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:04,458
and remember

517
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:07,125
every time you choose presence over scrolling

518
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,833
you're not just fighting a ghost

519
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,500
you're awakening a Buddha
