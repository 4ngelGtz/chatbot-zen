endlessly scrolling at 3:00 a.m. feeling

18
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,200
Hollow but unable to stop that's when

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,680
Buddha's ancient wisdom hit me in a way

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,600
I never

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,320
expected in a previous video we ventured

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,000
through the chilling Realms of Buddhist

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,600
Hells but there's another realm closer

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,159
to us a realm of hungry Ang R ghosts

25
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,399
unlike the Demons of Hell these ghosts

26
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,360
aren't locked away somewhere distant

27
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,280
they're already here hiding in our

28
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,200
habits haunting our minds like a Hungry

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,960

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,159

38
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,479
fill an endless craving that drives you

39
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,319

warned us about creatures trapped in a

reality of their own

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,400
because while staring at that endless

70
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,000
feed Buddha's words echoed in my mind

71
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,599
like a fish caught in a drying stream

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,840
mind thrashing in its thirst for

73
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:29,879
more imagine this a being with a body

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,080
the size of a house but a neck thinner

75
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:35,480
than a needle always starving Never

76
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,799
Satisfied even if they find an entire

77
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,159
ocean of water it turns to fire the

78
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,599
moment it touches their lips in Buddhism

79
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,760
this isn't just a spooky story it's one

80
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,720
of the six Realms we can be reborn into

81
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,760
if we let our Cravings control us but

82
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,000

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,520
feeding a ghost that never gets full 7

before as Buddha said desires are never

124
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:44,160
fulfilled by Indulgence think about your

scrolling that's not just boredom that's

128
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,039
your Hungry Ghost throwing a tantrum

129
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,880
because no matter how much content it

130
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,120
consumes it's still starving but before

131
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,240
you panic there's something you need to

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,960
understand about these ghosts something

133
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,039

poisons that trap us in suffering greed

139
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,680
hatred and

140
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,039
delusion today these poisons show up as

141
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,479
different types of digital hunger and

142
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:29,919

165
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,319
six hours of swiping right on Strangers

166
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,720

I mentioned no phones loud first 3 days

178
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,520
felt like withdrawal because it was the

179
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,520
three poisons were detoxing from my

180
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,080
system the scariest part these ghosts

visiting the Hungry Ghost realm you're

187
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,879
building a vacation home there the

188
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,560
craving that binds us Buddha taught is

189
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,919
stronger than Prison Walls try putting

190
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,440
down your phone for an hour feel that

191
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:38,800
itch that anxiety that fomo creeping in

192
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,279
that's not you that's your ghost

193
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,159
throwing a tantrum and just when you

194
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,279
think you've got it under control these

195
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:49,040
ghosts start running your entire

196
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:51,600
schedule remember my 3:00 a.m. story

197
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,680
that was just the beginning let me show

198
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,360
you exactly how these hungry ghosts

199
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,360
hijack your

200
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,480
day time for some ghost hunting in your

201
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,600
daily routine Buddha taught that

202
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,480
awareness is the first step to Freedom

203
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,800
after my retreat I started tracking my

204
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,440
own ghost moments and trust me what I

205
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,240
discovered changed everything morning

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,720

grabbed your phone fun fact monks wake

209

up at 4:00 a.m. and their first action

210
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:27,800
is taking three mindful breaths us

211
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,959
Instagram email Tik Tok Facebook Twitter

212
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,000
every app gets checked not because you

213
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,040
need to but because your ghost is

214
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,920
already starving the mind is everything

215
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,240
what you think you become Bud's words

216
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,200
hit different when you realize you're

217
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,680

focusing you're checking crypto prices

221
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,720

222
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,279

224
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:03,240
day checking my crypto portfolio

225
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,800
the three poisons in action Greed for

226
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,360

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,160
remember my Thailand Story the most

239
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,320
powerful moment wasn't the meditation it

240
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:51,600

scroll midnight passes 1:00 a.m. 2: a.m.

246
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:10,040
in Buddhist monasteries they say the

247
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,880
Hungry Ghost realm is strongest at night

248
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,800
looking at our phone habits they might

249
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,839
be on to

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:21,959

own unguarded thoughts the most ruthless

259
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,720

about your 2 a.m. digital binges nobody

263
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,519
suspects you're possessed but your

264
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,720
screen time numbers they tell a

265
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,240
different story just like my 9-hour

266
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,040
wakeup call these numbers don't

267
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,519
lie and speaking of wakeup calls there's

268
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,360
an ancient Buddhist story that

269
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,360
completely changed how I view digital

270
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,240
addiction you know what else doesn't lie

271
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,079
ancient Buddhist wisdom and there's one

272
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,800
story That Shook Me Harder than my own

273
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,519
300 a.m. Rock

274
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,839
Bottom the past is already gone the

275
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:26,120
future is not yet here there is only the

276
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,160
present moment Buddha taught this but

277
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,199
watch how it plays out in this

278
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,240
story meet ma gayana Buddha's most

279
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:35,040
gifted disciple think of him as the

280
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,519
ancient world's greatest

281
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,519
Ghostbuster during my time in Thailand

282
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,199
my teacher compared him to a spiritual

283
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:45,639
superhero he could read mines fly

284
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:47,320
through walls travel between Realms the

285
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,240
spiritual equivalent of having every

286
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,839
Premium app subscription blue check mark

287
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,760
and viral post

288
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,120
combined but one day he discovered

289
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,240
something that shattered his world his

290
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,560
own mother reborn in the hungry ghost

291
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,600
realm let that sink in the most

292
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,199
connected person in the spiritual World

293
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,600
couldn't even help his own mom every

294
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:13,199
piece of food he manifested turned to

295
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,839
fire in her mouth every drop of water

296
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:18,000
became acid I remember sitting in

297
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,560
meditation thinking about my own mom's

298
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,720
Facebook addiction and this story hit

299
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,000
differently here was the most powerful

300
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,560
monk in history powerless to help his

301
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,680
own mother just like many of us feel

302
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,839
powerless watching our loved on scroll

303
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,800
their lives away desperate he ran to

304
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,320
Buddha and here's where it gets real

305
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,360
Buddha dropped a truth bomb that

306
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,079
explains everything you're experiencing

307
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,560
right now the Hungry Ghost realm isn't

308
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:48,199
just a place it's a state of

309
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,600
mind one of the six Realms we create

310
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:53,279
with our own cravings and no amount of

311
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,800
power money or followers can free you

312
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,839
from it the

313
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,360
solution this is what blew my mind

314
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:04,240
during a retreat it wasn't meditation it

315
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,240
wasn't prayers it wasn't even Buddha's

316
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,399
direct intervention it was Community

317
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:13,040
Connection real human bonds Buddha

318
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,800
taught in the end only three things

319
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,000
matter how much you loved how gently you

320
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,680
lived and how gracefully you let go of

321
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,680
things not meant for you only when the

322
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,680
entire Buddhist Community came together

323
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,880
sharing their Merit their positive

324
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,639
actions their genuine concern only then

325
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,759
was M Galay Yana's mother mother freed

326
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,519
from her ghostly prison think about that

327
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:38,000
the world's most powerful monk couldn't

328
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:40,600
save one person alone but together they

329
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,120
changed everything just like my own

330
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,560
Journey it wasn't an app or a hack that

331
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,720
helped me Break Free it was joining a

332
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,160
meditation group sharing struggles

333
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,959
finding real connection now look at your

334
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,880
phone again those notifications those

335
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,720
likes those followers are they filling

336
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,240
your hunger or are they keeping you

337
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,759
trapped like mgal y's mother in an

338
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,480
endless cycle of craving but don't worry

339
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,800
just like buddha showed mgal Yana the

340
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,120
way out I'm about to show you how to

341
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,120

free Breaking Free from your Hungry

343
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:15,720
Ghost isn't about deleting all your apps

344
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,920
or throwing your phone into a river

345
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,839
Buddha never taught Extreme Measures he

346
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,639
taught the middle way during my retreat

347
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:26,279
I tried the whole digital detox thing

348
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:30,920
guess what happened when I got back

349
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:34,800
Ghost came back stronger as Buddha said

350
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:38,120
neither fire nor wind nor birth nor

351
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,199
death can erase our Good Deeds so let's

352
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:44,319

spend hours is making perfect Instagram

392

394
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,280
different purpose ghosts can't stand

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:46,559
genuine contribution it breaks the third

396
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:48,200
poison hatred or aversion to what's real

397
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,440
but here's the ninja move I learned from

398
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,919
my teacher turn your ghost habits into

399
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,559
human habits use that Instagram account

400
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:58,159
to share real moments not filtered

401
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:00,280
facades transform your YouTube binges

402
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:02,240
into learning session sessions convert

403
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,000

404
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,159
Community

405
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,320
participation the secret ghosts feed on

406
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:12,919
isolation they starve in connection

407
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,400
every real conversation every genuine

408
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:18,320
laugh every actual human moment weakens

409
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,720
their grip Buddha said it

410
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,799
best thousands of candles can be lit

411
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,480
from a single candle and the life of the

412
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:28,200
candle will not be shortened and those

413
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,600
withdrawal symptoms I mentioned earlier

414
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,799
they're not per perent I know because

415
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,559
I've been there your ghost will throw

416
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,159
Tantrums it will beg for attention it

417
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:40,159
will promise that the next scroll will

418
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:42,679
finally satisfy you but now you know

419
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:44,919
better because here's what M galana

420
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:47,960
really taught us even the most powerful

421
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:50,080
beings need a system a protocol a way to

422
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,440
maintain their freedom and that's

423
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,440
exactly what I'm about to show

424
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,280
you your ghost free PowerUp protocol

425
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,320
Starts Now Buddha taught that Liberation

426
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,559
comes in stages think of this as your

427
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,280
spiritual video game three levels to

428
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,640
break free from the Hungry Ghost realm

429
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,559
let me share something I learned the

430
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,919
hard way after Thailand I thought I was

431
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,919
cured then I downloaded Tik Tok game

432
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,919
over that's when my teacher shared

433
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:23,039
Buddha's wisdom drop by drop fills the

434
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:25,000
bucket small changes consistent practice

435
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,159

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,960
track your ghost moments in real time

440
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:43,200
when do they appear what triggers them

441
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:46,240
my ghost it loves 4 p.m. that post lunch

442
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,559
pre- evening slump once I knew that I

443
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,200
could prepare now it's meditation time

444
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:53,840
your ghost hates being watched because

445
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,039
awareness is cryptonite to craving level

446
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,080
two Freedom practices remember the six

447
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:04,600
Realms we're aiming for the human realm

448
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:07,360

450
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,360
my routine learned from monks first hour

451
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,520
after waking sacred no phones just

452
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:18,360
breathing moving existing your ghost

453
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,080
will hate these zones at first good as

454
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,320
Buddha said discomfort is the gateway to

455
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,320
peace create a morning ritual that

456
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,960
doesn't involve screens could be

457
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,120
meditation could be push-ups could be

458
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,880
staring at clouds

459
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,240
I started with 1 minute of

460
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,039
meditation now 30 minutes feel

461
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,039
short what matters is you're choosing

462
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:43,880
reality over digital

463
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,120
demons level three the ultimate power

464
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,880
move this is where you become the Ghost

465
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,880
Hunter instead of the Haunted take those

466
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,320
ghost triggering moments and flip them

467
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,520
social media

00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,600

cursed your apps aren't evil as Buddha

484
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:41,440
taught it's not the objects that bind us

485
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,760
but our attachment to them your ghost

486
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,159
it's counting on your unconscious

487
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,480
patterns to stay alive but now you have

488
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:50,640

489
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,559
game look at your phone right now that

493
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,039
as Buddha said when the student is ready

494
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,440

last personal story remember that 3:00

497
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,799
a.m. scrolling moment I mentioned that

498
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,279
night I hit rock bottom 9 hours of

499
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,240
screen time zero real

500
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:23,840
connections but that Moment of clarity

501
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,960

502
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,240

506
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,640

you'll recognize who's really scratching

509
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,240
that's not defeat that's awareness and

510
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,640
as Buddha taught awareness is the path

511
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,840
to

512
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,159
immortality think about mod

513
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,120
galana even with all his supernatural

514
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:56,200
abilities he needed something more

515
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:58,840
powerful than magic he needed awareness

516
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,440
connection community
