1
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:08,500
what happens when

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,458
two philosophical giants face off about

3
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:12,541
the most fundamental human experience

4
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,583
one says escape your suffering

5
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:17,333
the other says embrace it

6
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,000
Buddha

7
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:20,875
life is suffering

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,250
Nietzsche what doesn't kill you makes you stronger

9
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,833
who's right and more importantly

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,375
whose advice will actually change your life

11
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,541
two philosophers

12
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,291
two radically different approaches to human suffering

13
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,958
but which one actually works let's find out

14
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,416
hey everyone

15
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,375
Matt here from Buddha's wisdom

16
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,500
and today we're doing something a little different

17
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:47,958
we're putting

18
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,625
two of history's most influential thinkers into a

19
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,125
philosophical face off

20
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:52,791
to see

21
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,833
whose approach to suffering actually works better

22
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,500
in the east corner we have Siddhartha Gautama

23
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,875
better known as the Buddha

24
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,833
if you watched our video about his life

25
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,625
you already know his incredible journey

26
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:08,125
from privileged prince to enlightened teacher

27
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,708
this guy figured out how to overcome suffering

28
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,833
around 2,500 years ago

29
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,333
and people are still following his advice today

30
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,833
and in the west corner weighing in

31
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:18,500
with probably

32
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,416
the most impressive mustache in philosophical history

33
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,333
we have Friedrich Nietzsche

34
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,000
the German philosopher who told us "god is dead"

35
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,166
questioned everything about society

36
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:32,458
and believed suffering wasn't just inevitable

37
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,833
it was actually valuable

38
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:39,708
these two never met they lived about 2,400 years apart

39
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,500
but they both tackled the same massive question

40
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,500
why do we suffer and what should we do about it

41
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,125
now I know what you're thinking

42
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,458
this might sound heavy but

43
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:50,666
these two brilliant minds

44
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,208
developed strategies that millions of people still use

45
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,458
today to find meaning

46
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,958
purpose and yes

47
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,291
even happiness

48
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,458
whether you're dealing with a breakup

49
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,125
struggling with work stress or just feeling lost

50
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,000
Buddha and Nietzsche have surprisingly practical

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,541
advice that could completely change your perspective

52
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,083
so get comfortable

53
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,166
and prepare to have your mind expanded

54
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,666
as we explore two

55
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,416
radically different

56
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,500
approaches to life's biggest challenge

57
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,416
let's get to know our philosophical heavyweights

58
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,833
before we jump into their ideas about suffering

59
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,375
first up Buddha

60
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,666
born Siddhartha Gautama around 563 BCE

61
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,125
in what's now Nepal

62
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,166
this guy had everything wealth

63
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,166
luxury a gorgeous palace

64
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:40,416
his father

65
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,791
was so determined to protect him from suffering

66
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,916
that he built walls to keep the real world out

67
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,708
but one day Siddhartha snuck out

68
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,916
and saw four sites that changed everything

69
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,583
an old man a sick person

70
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,791
a dead body and a wandering holy man

71
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:58,791
for the first time

72
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,500
he realized suffering was inevitable for everyone

73
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,250
including himself

74
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,166
so at 29 he walked away from his palace

75
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:10,291
wealth and even his family to find answers

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,708
after six years of extreme

77
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,958
spiritual practices that led nowhere

78
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,791
he discovered the middle way

79
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,208
sitting under the Bodie tree

80
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:22,666
he reached enlightenment and spent the next 45 years

81
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,875
teaching others how to end suffering

82
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,333
his solution

83
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,833
suffering comes from desire and attachment

84
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,583
so the path to freedom is learning to let go

85
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,791
now fast forward about 2,400 years

86
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,125
to meet Friedrich Nietzsche

87
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,625
born in 1844 in Prussia

88
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:46,166
unlike Buddha Nietzsche didn't start with luxury

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,166
his father died when he was just four

90
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,291
and by 24 he became the youngest professor ever

91
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,708
at the university of Basel

92
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,625
but his life was filled with suffering

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,625
debilitating health problems

94
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,458
a disastrous love life and

95
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,541
he lived during a time

96
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,500
when traditional values were crumbling

97
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,291
science challenged religion

98
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,708
industrialization transformed society

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,791
and people questioned everything

100
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,500
in this chaos

101
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,000
Nietzsche didn't seek escape from suffering

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
instead he developed a philosophy that

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,166
embraced life's hardships

104
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,791
as necessary for growth

105
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,791
what does not kill me makes me stronger

106
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:24,958
that's Nietzsche

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,375
you've heard this everywhere

108
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,541
from Conan the Barbarian's grim determination

109
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,125
to Joker's chaos philosophy

110
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,291
in The Dark Knight

111
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,083
Kelly Clarkson turned it into a pop anthem

112
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,875
and Kanye West sampled it

113
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,500
but before it became the ultimate comeback line

114
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,666
it was Nietzsche's deeply personal philosophy

115
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,208
for facing life's challenges

116
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,875
so here we have two thinkers

117
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,166
shaped by completely different worlds

118
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,750
Buddha born into luxury

119
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,416
chose to confront suffering by abandoning comfort

120
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,666
Nietzsche plagued by illness and rejection

121
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,458
transformed his personal struggles into a philosophy

122
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,291
celebrating life's difficulties

123
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,708
as we explore their ideas

124
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,083
remember these weren't just abstract theories

125
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,041
but hard one insights from lives

126
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,791
defined by the search for meaning amid suffering

127
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,666
so which approach makes more sense for your life

128
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,500
now that we know who Buddha was

129
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,625
let's dive into his revolutionary ideas about suffering

130
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,291
that have helped millions find peace

131
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,625
for over two millennia

132
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,750
if you've watched our video about Samsara

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,375
you already know that Buddha saw suffering as part of a

134
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,416
larger cycle

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,375
but what exactly did he mean by suffering

136
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,416
in Pali the language of Buddha's teachings

137
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,875
the word is dukkha

138
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,625
dukkha is tricky to translate precisely

139
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,541
it's not just pain or sadness

140
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,125
it's more like

141
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,083
a persistent dissatisfaction that follows us around

142
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,416
think about getting something you've wanted for ages

143
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,041
maybe the latest phone

144
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:01,208
a job promotion or a date with your crush

145
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,000
you feel amazing for a while

146
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,750
then that happiness fades

147
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,125
and you're back to wanting something else

148
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,166
Buddha noticed this pattern and said

149
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,541
well wait a minute

150
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,083
this never ends

151
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,250
even when things are good

152
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,625
there's this underlying sense that something's off

153
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,583
or missing

154
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,833
this understanding became the first noble truth

155
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,125
life contains inevitable suffering

156
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,541
but Buddha didn't stop there

157
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,833
he dug deeper to find the cause

158
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,125
which brings us to the second noble truth

159
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,416
suffering comes from craving and attachment

160
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,375
think about your favorite food

161
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,250
wanting it isn't the problem

162
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,333
the suffering comes when you cling to the experience

163
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,625
when you can't enjoy your meal

164
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,791
because you're already sad

165
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,041
it's almost over

166
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,625
or when you're comparing it to a better version you had

167
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,416
before

168
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,791
we do this with everything relationships

169
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,541
achievements even our own identities

170
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,000
as we explored in our video about love and attachment

171
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,291
Buddha distinguished between healthy desire

172
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,625
and the clinging that causes suffering

173
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,458
you can love deeply without the desperate grasping

174
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,625
that turns love into a source of pain

175
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,083
Buddha explained that we get caught in samsara

176
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,083
that endless cycle of birth

177
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:21,333
death and rebirth we talked about in previous videos

178
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,041
we chase pleasure

179
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,375
avoid pain and cling to our idea of who we are

180
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,208
but everything changes

181
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,375
so this approach guarantees suffering

182
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,833
the alternative Nirvana

183
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,916
not the 90s grunge band

184
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,541
but a state where you're free from the endless wanting

185
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,541
it's not about feeling nothing

186
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,791
it's about not being controlled by your cravings

187
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:46,041
and aversions let me make this super practical

188
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,458
imagine you're scrolling through social media

189
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,541
seeing all those perfect lives

190
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,875
you feel inadequate and want what others have

191
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,208
that's dukkha in action

192
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,500
the Buddha would say

193
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,875
your suffering comes not from lacking what they have

194
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,500
but from the craving itself

195
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,708
the solution isn't getting more followers

196
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,750
or a fancier vacation to post about

197
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,416
it's recognizing that the cycle of comparison

198
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,916
and craving never ends

199
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,166
there's always someone with more likes

200
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,416
more adventures more apparent happiness

201
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,958
Buddha's approach is radical

202
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,166
train your mind to observe these cravings

203
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,708
without being ruled by them

204
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,958
this doesn't mean becoming some emotionless robot

205
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,250
it means experiencing life's pleasures

206
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,791
without desperate attachment

207
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,666
and facing difficulties without being crushed by them

208
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,625
when you understand impermanence

209
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,625
that everything changes you can enjoy good times

210
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,375
without desperately clutching them

211
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,500
and you can endure tough times knowing they'll pass too

212
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,250
this insight led Buddha to develop the Eightfold Path

213
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,625
practical steps like ethical behavior

214
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,250
mindfulness

215
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,125
and meditation that help break the cycle of suffering

216
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,625
these aren't just spiritual practices

217
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,416
they're practical tools for living with greater ease

218
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,000
for Buddha

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,500
suffering isn't something heroic to power through

220
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,666
it's an unnecessary burden we can learn to put down

221
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and the reward isn't just feeling better

222
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,416
it's freedom from the endless cycle of craving

223
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,625
that keeps us trapped

224
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,958
for Buddha freedom comes

225
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,166
when we stop clinging to what we can't control

226
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,458
Nietzsche however

227
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,875
saw suffering through an entirely different lens

228
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,625
while Buddha was all about letting go of attachments

229
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,791
to end suffering

230
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,541
Nietzsche took a completely different approach

231
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,750
if Buddha's philosophy was let it go

232
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,458
Nietzsche's was more like bring it on

233
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,625
Nietzsche identified two

234
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,375
fundamentally different ways people face suffering

235
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,916
the first is what he called reactive

236
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,750
when we experience pain

237
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,625
and immediately try to blame someone or something

238
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,500
it's not fair why me

239
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,833
it's their fault

240
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,708
sound familiar Nietzsche called this "ressentiment"

241
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,208
French pronunciation bonus points if you can nail it

242
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,000
and he saw it as a weak response

243
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,500
that keeps people stuck

244
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,375
the second approach is active

245
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,666
accepting suffering as part of life

246
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,625
and using it as fuel for growth

247
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,541
instead of asking why is this happening to me

248
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:20,291
the active person asks what can I become through this

249
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,708
this is where Nietzsche's famous quote comes from

250
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,375
what does not kill me makes me stronger

251
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,666
at the core of Nietzsche's philosophy

252
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,875
is something he called the will to power

253
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,958
now this isn't about dominating others

254
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,291
or becoming some muscle bound dictator

255
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,708
it's more subtle and profound

256
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,208
the will to power is about self mastery and growth

257
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,250
it's the drive to overcome obstacles

258
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,291
including your own limitations

259
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,041
think of it like this

260
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,166
when you push through intense exercise

261
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,833
even though your muscles are burning

262
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,666
you're expressing will to power

263
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,458
when you face a fear instead of avoiding it

264
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,833
that's will to power

265
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,916
when you create something meaningful despite criticism

266
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,625
that's will to power too

267
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,458
for Nietzsche suffering isn't just inevitable

268
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,750
it's necessary for becoming who you truly are

269
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,958
he wrote the discipline of suffering

270
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,875
of great suffering do you not know that

271
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,208
it is this discipline alone

272
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,041
that has created all enhancements of man

273
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,000
so far

274
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,458
let's make this concrete

275
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,125
imagine you're going through a painful breakup

276
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,291
the Buddha might advise you to

277
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,583
recognize your attachment to the relationship

278
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,458
and gradually let go of the craving for what was

279
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,666
Nietzsche would say

280
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,750
use this pain

281
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,791
let it reveal your dependencies

282
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,375
challenge your assumptions about love

283
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:47,500
and forge you into someone stronger and more authentic

284
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,666
Nietzsche even developed a concept called amor fati

285
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,416
the love of fate

286
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,500
this isn't just accepting whatever happens to you

287
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,416
it's actively embracing it

288
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,375
imagine getting fired

289
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,750
and instead of thinking this sucks

290
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,291
you think

291
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,375
this is exactly what needed to happen for my growth

292
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,125
that's some next level mental reframing

293
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,791
one of my favorite Nietzsche quotes

294
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,625
captures this mindset perfectly

295
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,166
I wanna learn more and more

296
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,625
to see as beautiful what is necessary in things

297
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,250
then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful

298
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:27,000
in other words don't just accept the obstacles

299
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,375
in your path appreciate them

300
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,291
as the very things that make your journey meaningful

301
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,583
while Buddha sought a path out of suffering

302
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,125
through detachment Nietzsche saw suffering as

303
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,708
the resistance that builds our spiritual muscles

304
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,958
without it we remain weak

305
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,583
comfortable and in his view

306
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,208
less than fully alive

307
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,625
Nietzsche didn't just develop his ideas in isolation

308
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,458
he directly challenged Buddha's approach

309
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,791
with criticisms that reveal

310
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,958
the heart of their philosophical conflict

311
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,750
while Buddha and Nietzsche never met

312
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,958
Nietzsche definitely knew about Buddhism

313
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,041
and guess what he was not a fan

314
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,708
in fact he launched

315
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:09,416
some serious

316
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,916
criticisms against Buddha's approach to suffering

317
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,625
that reveal

318
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,041
the heart of their philosophical disagreement

319
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,833
Nietzsche called Buddhism a nihilistic philosophy

320
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
strong words that need context

321
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,833
while he actually admired Buddhism

322
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,000
for being more realistic

323
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,750
and psychologically sophisticated than Christianity

324
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,000
he misunderstood Buddha's Nirvana

325
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,416
as a form of nothingness or escape

326
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,125
for Nietzsche

327
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,375
this path away from suffering

328
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,500
looks suspiciously like giving up on life's vitality

329
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,750
in his book The Antichrist

330
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:43,625
Nietzsche wrote that

331
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,750
Buddhism represents the struggle against suffering

332
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,291
nothing but that

333
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,750
he saw Buddha's approach as essentially saying

334
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,375
life is suffering

335
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,458
so let's find a way to stop participating in it

336
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,708
so deeply to Nietzsche

337
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,625
this was a form of surrender

338
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,916
a retreat from life rather than a full embrace of it

339
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,541
Nietzsche's harshest criticism

340
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,916
was that Buddhism represented

341
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,333
what he called life denial

342
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,416
in his view Buddha's teachings

343
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,916
encouraged people to withdraw from

344
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,583
the intensity of existence

345
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,750
its pleasures as well

346
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,875
as its pains in favor of a calm detachment

347
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,583
for someone who believed in saying yes to life

348
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,166
in all its messy glory

349
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,625
this seemed like a philosophy of no

350
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,625
the core disagreement comes down to this

351
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:34,458
should suffering be transcended or transformed

352
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,416
Buddha taught that suffering stems from our attachments

353
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,416
and cravings

354
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,208
the solution is to recognize these patterns

355
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,458
and gradually free ourselves from them

356
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,500
the ultimate goal Nirvana

357
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,041
is liberation from the cycle of suffering

358
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,166
Nietzsche on the other hand

359
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,541
saw suffering as essential to human growth

360
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,458
without resistance there's no strength

361
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,000
without challenges no triumph

362
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,125
removing suffering would mean

363
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,916
removing the very conditions that allow for greatness

364
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,541
let's break this down with an example

365
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,916
imagine you're an artist facing rejection

366
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,291
Buddha might advise

367
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,125
you to examine your attachment to external validation

368
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,333
and recognition

369
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,875
your suffering comes not from the rejection itself

370
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,833
but from your craving for success and fear of failure

371
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,791
as you let go of these attachments

372
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,791
the rejection loses its sting

373
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,791
Nietzsche would take a completely different approach

374
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,625
he'd say use this rejection

375
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,125
let it fuel your determination

376
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,750
create even more boldly

377
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,916
in Defiance of those who dismissed you

378
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,083
the suffering itself can be transformed into the

379
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,166
energy that drives your greatest work

380
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,000
one approach seeks to transcend suffering

381
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,791
by detaching from the causes

382
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,666
the other seeks to transform suffering into

383
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,125
the raw material for growth and creation

384
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,458
this reveals another key distinction

385
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,833
active versus passive approaches to life's challenges

386
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,791
Nietzsche characterized Buddha's path as

387
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,375
fundamentally passive

388
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,125
a way of accepting what is and detaching from desire

389
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:16,041
in contrast his own philosophy was radically active

390
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,541
imposing your will upon circumstances

391
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,291
and creating meaning through struggle

392
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,125
it's like the difference between weathering a storm

393
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,500
by finding shelter

394
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,500
versus learning to dance in the rain

395
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,875
both approaches deal with the storm

396
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,166
but in fundamentally different ways

397
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,833
so who's right

398
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,125
is suffering something to overcome through detachment

399
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,041
as Buddha taught or

400
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:38,333
is it

401
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,916
the essential resistance that builds our character

402
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,291
as Nietzsche believed

403
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,791
the answer might not be as clear cut

404
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,875
as either philosopher would have us believe

405
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,208
in fact despite their profound disagreement

406
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,333
Buddha and Nietzsche

407
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,500
shared some surprising common ground

408
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,791
and that's what will explore next

409
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,000
you might think

410
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Buddha and Nietzsche are philosophical opposites

411
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,458
after everything we've covered

412
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,833
one says escape suffering

413
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,416
the other says embrace it

414
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,583
but dig deeper and you'll find

415
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,416
these great thinkers

416
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,500
share some surprising similarities

417
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,750
first both were radical truth seekers

418
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,541
who challenged the status quo

419
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,750
Buddha rejected the rigid cast system

420
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,916
and extreme aestheticism of his time

421
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,000
he questioned religious dogma

422
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,416
and encouraged followers to test his teachings

423
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,375
rather than accept them blindly

424
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,791
don't believe anything simply because you've heard it

425
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,791
he taught similarly

426
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,416
Nietzsche took a sledgehammer to conventional morality

427
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,833
and traditional religion

428
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,791
his famous declaration that god is dead

429
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,583
wasn't celebrating atheism

430
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,250
as much as recognizing that modern society

431
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,416
had moved beyond simply accepting religious authority

432
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,500
both men refuse to accept

433
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,666
the conventional wisdom of their times

434
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,041
and forged their own paths

435
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,125
second Buddha and Nietzsche

436
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,500
both targeted illusion as the enemy

437
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,625
Buddha's concept of Maya

438
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,583
refers to the illusions that cloud our perception

439
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,500
and keep us trapped in suffering

440
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,833
his entire practice aims to see through these illusions

441
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,375
to perceive reality as it truly is

442
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,083
Nietzsche was

443
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,833
equally concerned with how humans deceive themselves

444
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,000
he criticized the herd mentality

445
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,791
that makes people blindly follow social norms

446
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,000
he challenged people to question inherited values

447
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,541
and create authentic ones

448
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,125
both philosophers were essentially saying

449
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,666
wake up you're living in a dream

450
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,416
constructed by society and your own mind

451
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,375
perhaps most surprisingly

452
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,416
Buddha and Nietzsche

453
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,791
shared fascinating insights about the self

454
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,291
Buddha taught anatta or no self

455
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,625
the idea that what we call ourself isn't a fixed

456
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,750
permanent entity

457
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,625
but a collection of constantly changing processes

458
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,541
when we cling to a rigid identity

459
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,125
we create suffering

460
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,000
Nietzsche approached this from a different angle

461
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,875
but reached a similar conclusion

462
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,625
he wrote that there is no being behind doing

463
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,208
affecting becoming

464
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,083
the doer is merely a fiction added to the deed

465
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,625
he saw the self as something fluid

466
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:25,291
and created through action not a fixed essence

467
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,750
both thinkers recognize that clinging to rigid

468
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,250
ideas about who we are

469
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,958
limits our potential and creates unnecessary suffering

470
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,166
freedom comes from recognizing that we aren't fixed

471
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,000
entities

472
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,916
but dynamic processes capable of transformation

473
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,208
even their views on desire share common ground

474
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,166
while Buddha advocated detachment from craving

475
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,625
he didn't promote emotionless existence

476
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:54,083
the goal was freedom from being controlled by desires

477
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,958
not freedom from having them

478
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:01,250
Nietzsche despite celebrating passion and intensity

479
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,791
also warned against being enslaved by one's impulses

480
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:09,500
both valued self mastery and freedom from compulsion

481
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,000
if Buddha and Nietzsche sat down for coffee

482
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,625
they might agree that most people live unconsciously

483
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,000
trapped in illusions

484
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,375
freedom requires seeing through social conditioning

485
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,916
the self is not what most people think it is

486
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,083
truth matters more than comfort

487
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,250
suffering has meaning and purpose

488
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,250
though they debate what that purpose is

489
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,875
their approaches to suffering might look like opposites

490
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:35,833
on the surface

491
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:39,000
but both offer paths to freedom and authenticity

492
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,500
both challenge us to wake up from sleep

493
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
walking through life

494
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,791
and take responsibility for our experience

495
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,541
these surprisingly similar thinkers

496
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,416
offer complimentary tools

497
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,500
not competing philosophies

498
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,333
the wisdom lies in knowing which approach to use

499
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,791
when life challenges you

500
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,500
and that's the practical guide we're about to build

501
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:03,583
so

502
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,000
we've explored Buddha's path of transcending suffering

503
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,250
through detachment and Nietzsche's approach

504
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,041
of transforming suffering into strength

505
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,041
now comes the practical part

506
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,125
how do you actually

507
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,416
use these philosophies in your daily life

508
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:19,875
the truth is

509
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,708
neither approach works perfectly for every situation

510
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,833
sometimes detachment is exactly what you need

511
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,250
other times you need to lean into the struggle

512
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,666
and let it strengthen you

513
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,875
the wisdom comes in knowing which approach to use when

514
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,750
let's break this down into a practical guide

515
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,625
when to use Buddha's approach

516
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,958
when facing situations you truly can't change

517
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,416
when dealing with minor annoyances

518
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,333
that don't matter in the big picture

519
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:49,375
when your own

520
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,000
expectations are causing unnecessary suffering

521
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,875
when attachments to outcomes are clouding your judgment

522
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,916
when ruminating on past events that can't be undone

523
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,375
for example

524
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,666
you're stuck in traffic and getting frustrated

525
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,416
the Buddha would suggest

526
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,708
observing your frustration without feeding it

527
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,333
notice how your body feels

528
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,583
how your thoughts spiral and then let it go

529
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,583
the traffic won't move faster because you're angry

530
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,041
so why suffer

531
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,291
when to use Nietzsche's approach

532
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,958
when facing challenges that will help you grow

533
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:27,083
when pursuing meaningful goals despite difficulties

534
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,708
when standing up for your values requires strength

535
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,583
when creativity requires pushing through resistance

536
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:33,291
when building

537
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,833
resilience is more important than immediate comfort

538
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,000
say you're training for a Marathon

539
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,708
mile 18 hits and your legs feel like concrete

540
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,875
every instinct screams to stop

541
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:46,166
Buddha might tell you detach from the pain

542
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,125
observe it without resistance

543
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,708
let go of suffering

544
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,458
Nietzsche he'd say

545
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,041
lean into the burn

546
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,291
because that agony is what makes you unbreakable

547
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:01,500
the most powerful approach combines both philosophies

548
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,916
start by using Buddha's mindfulness

549
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,500
to clearly see your situation

550
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,583
without being clouded by reactivity

551
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:11,875
ask yourself is this suffering serving a purpose

552
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,583
is it helping me grow towards something meaningful

553
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:17,041
if not practice detachment

554
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,541
if yes channel your inner Nietzsche

555
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,416
and use that suffering as fuel

556
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,791
here's a simple exercise you can try right now

557
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:27,708
think of something that's causing you suffering

558
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,708
first take the Buddha approach

559
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,625
observe it with detachment

560
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,750
recognizing any attachments or cravings involved

561
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,333
then take Nietzsche's view

562
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:39,125
ask

563
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,625
how this challenge might be necessary for your growth

564
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,875
or what strength that might be building in you

565
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,291
science actually supports this flexible approach

566
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,750
research on resilience shows that both acceptance

567
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,791
and active coping strategies are essential

568
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:53,833
for mental health

569
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:56,500
psychologists have found mindfulness

570
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,708
Buddhist territory

571
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,166
reduces stress and improves well being

572
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,500
while post traumatic growth studies

573
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,916
Nietzsche's wheelhouse

574
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:06,625
show that facing adversity often leads to positive

575
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,166
personal transformation

576
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,833
the Buddha Nietzsche hybrid approach

577
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,500
gives you a complete tool kit

578
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,875
the calm clarity to accept what can't be changed

579
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:19,250
and the fierce determination to transform what can

580
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,625
remember that both philosophers wanted the same thing

581
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,458
for humanity freedom

582
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,625
Buddha sought freedom from the tyranny of craving

583
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:28,625
and attachment

584
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:32,291
Nietzsche sought freedom from societal constraints

585
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:33,666
and self deception

586
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:37,500
both wanted humans to live more authentic

587
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:38,875
meaningful lives

588
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,000
your path to freedom lies

589
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,333
not in rigidly following either philosophy

590
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:46,000
but in having the wisdom to know when to let go

591
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,458
and when to push through

592
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,500
that's not just philosophical theory

593
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,750
it's practical wisdom for living well

594
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,166
in a complex world

595
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,625
we've taken quite the journey

596
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,625
with these two philosophical giants

597
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:03,583
exploring

598
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,791
radically different approaches to one of life's most

599
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:07,291
universal experiences

600
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,083
suffering

601
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,375
Buddha showed us that much of our suffering comes from

602
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:14,083
attachment and craving

603
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:16,375
by practicing mindfulness

604
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,625
and gradually loosening our grip on desires

605
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:21,625
we can find freedom from the endless cycle of wanting

606
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,416
his path offers peace

607
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:26,750
clarity and release from unnecessary mental struggle

608
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:30,041
Nietzsche reminded us that struggle itself

609
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,625
can forge us into stronger

610
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,708
more authentic versions of ourselves

611
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:36,166
by embracing life's challenges

612
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,291
and transforming suffering into growth

613
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:41,208
we can create meaning even in difficulty

614
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,791
his approach offers strength

615
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,291
purpose and the exhilaration of overcoming

616
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:47,916
the real power comes

617
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:50,375
not from choosing one philosophy over the other

618
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:51,916
but from developing the wisdom

619
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:53,708
to know which approach serves us best

620
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:55,291
in different situations

621
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:58,708
sometimes letting go is the answer

622
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,583
other times pushing through is exactly what we need

623
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,291
what both philosophers agreed on is perhaps

624
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:09,750
most important most people live unconsciously

625
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:12,791
trapped in illusions and societal conditioning

626
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:15,583
true freedom starts with waking up

627
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,375
questioning assumptions

628
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:20,500
and taking responsibility for your experience

629
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,375
whether you lean more toward Buddha's

630
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:25,541
peaceful detachment or Nietzsche's passionate engagement

631
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:29,125
the key is moving through life with greater awareness

632
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:32,250
stop being pushed around by cravings

633
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,541
you don't understand

634
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,791
or conforming to ideals you've never questioned

635
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:40,458
what's your experience

636
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:42,541
with these different approaches to suffering

637
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,083
have you found one works better than the other

638
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,625
in certain situations

639
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,625
share your thoughts in the comments below

640
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,125
so here's my challenge for you

641
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:56,833
the next time you face suffering pause

642
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:59,000
ask yourself should I

643
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,500
let go of my attachment to how things should be

644
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:02,500
or should I

645
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,166
use this resistance to build something meaningful

646
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,458
the simple moment of reflection puts you on the path

647
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:12,458
both philosophers valued the path of conscious choice

648
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:14,875
rather than unconscious reaction

649
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:18,208

the answer might just change everything
