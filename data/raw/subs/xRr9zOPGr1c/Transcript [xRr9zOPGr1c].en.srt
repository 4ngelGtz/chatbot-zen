1
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:09,083
2,500 years ago

2
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:12,750
a man sat under a tree and changed the world forever

3
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:14,791
but what really happened that night

4
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,916
did Siddhartha Gautama gain superpowers

5
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,333
see the future

6
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:22,666
or was his discovery something far more surprising

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,041
the truth about enlightenment might shock you

8
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:26,166
and

9
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,541
if you think you know what it means to be enlightened

10
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:29,750
think again

11
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,500
hey friends

12
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,375
Matt here from Buddha's wisdom

13
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,291
today we're tackling Buddhism's biggest mystery

14
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,500
enlightenment

15
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,458
it's what the Buddha discovered under that bodie tree

16
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,458
it's what monks dedicate their entire lives to

17
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,833
and it's probably nothing like what you imagine

18
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:50,041
if you've watched our video on the 4 noble truths

19
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,375
you already know the basics of what Buddha taught

20
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,291
but today we're going deeper

21
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,541
we're uncovering what actually happens

22
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,416
when someone wakes up to reality

23
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,208
is enlightenment some magical state

24
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,083
where you float above your problems

25
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,166
is it something only ancient monks could achieve

26
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,583
or is it much closer than you think

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
as the Zen master Dogen said

28
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,875
if you cannot find the truth right where you are

29
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,958
where else do you expect to find it

30
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,041
that's our first clue

31
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,958
so grab your favorite meditation cushion

32
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:23,958
or just get comfortable wherever you are

33
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,583
because we're about to explore

34
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,250
what enlightenment really is

35
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,833
and why those who claim to have it probably don't

36
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,375
let's get started

37
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:39,666
picture this a man sits under a massive fig tree

38
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,250
he's been meditating for days hungry

39
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,291
exhausted

40
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,958
but determined to find the answer to human suffering

41
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:50,166
this isn't just any man it's Siddhartha Gautama

42
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:54,208
a former prince who gave up everything luxury

43
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:55,750
family

44
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,500
comfort

45
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,833
all to discover why we hurt

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,291
as night falls Siddhartha faces his own mind

47
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,291
according to Buddhist traditions

48
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,708
he encounters Mara

49
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,666
the embodiment of temptation and distraction

50
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,208
memories and desires arise

51
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,625
but he remains steady in his meditation

52
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,916
observing each thought without getting caught up in it

53
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,125
the Pali Canon tells us

54
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,916
something profound happened that night

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,666
through deep concentration

56
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,125
Siddhartha gained three specific insights

57
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:31,125
first he recalled his past lives

58
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:35,375
then he understood the cycle of rebirth for all beings

59
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:39,458
and finally he realized the four noble truths

60
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,166
the nature of suffering its cause

61
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:45,166
its end and the path to its end

62
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,666
when the morning star appeared in the sky

63
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,583
Siddhartha's understanding was complete

64
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,166
in his own words from the Dhammapada

65
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,083
through many births I wandered

66
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,000
seeking but not finding the builder of this house

67
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,291
painful is repeated birth

68
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,375
house builder you are seen

69
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,625
you shall build no house again

70
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,750
all your rafters are broken

71
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,458
your ridge pole shattered

72
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,416
my mind has attained the unconditioned

73
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,000
achieved is the end of craving

74
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,750
what's fascinating is what didn't change

75
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,583
the Buddha didn't become superhuman

76
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,083
he remained subject to physical pain

77
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,083
aging and bodily needs

78
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:33,416
what transformed was his relationship with experience

79
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,333
he no longer generated suffering around these natural

80
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,208
processes

81
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,958
as the respected monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu explains

82
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,625
the Buddha's awakening gave him

83
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,541
not a linear view of the cosmos

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,916
but a view of experience that was more like a hologram

85
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,750
he saw how suffering arises and how it ceases

86
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,625
through direct experience

87
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,541
not abstract theory

88
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,791
and this awakening led directly to compassion

89
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,541
the Buddha didn't retreat to isolation

90
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,958
instead he spent 45 years teaching others

91
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:09,125
the path he discovered his first discourse at Deer Park

92
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,625
wasn't about magical powers

93
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,500
but about the practical path to end suffering

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,666
let's talk about what most people think

95
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:23,125
Enlightenment looks like a glowing guru on a mountain

96
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,791
someone who's always peaceful

97
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,083
never gets angry

98
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,708
floats above the problems of everyday life

99
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,458
maybe they can read minds or predict the future

100
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,125
but here's the shocking truth

101
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,125
that's not enlightenment at all

102
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,458
real Buddhist masters throughout history

103
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,583
have described awakening very differently

104
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:42,708
when Zen master

105
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,875
Qingyuan was asked about his experience

106
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,500
he said something surprising

107
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,541
before I studied Zen

108
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:52,125
mountains were mountains and waters were waters

109
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,541
when I Learned Zen

110
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,208
mountains were no longer mountains and waters

111
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,583
no longer waters

112
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:01,583
but now mountains are once again mountains and waters

113
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,458
once again waters

114
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,041
what does that mean it means

115
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,041
enlightenment isn't about seeing something spectacular

116
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,625
it's about seeing ordinary reality without distortion

117
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,958
here's what's truly shocking

118
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,625
many Buddhist masters admit that awakening is initially

119
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:22,333
disappointing yes disappointing

120
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,875
The 13th century Zen master Dogen wrote that

121
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:29,000
enlightenment can feel like the most ordinary thing

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,083
in the world

123
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,208
you expect cosmic fireworks

124
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,625
and get regular Tuesday morning

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,708
the 9th century master Linji was even more provocative

126
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,583
when he said

127
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,750
if you meet the Buddha on the road kill him

128
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,416
he wasn't promoting violence

129
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,458
but warning against clinging to ideas of enlightenment

130
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,166
even the idea of becoming enlightened

131
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,750
becomes another obstacle

132
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,333
let me share one of my favorite Zen stories

133
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,500
a monk asked Master Zhaozhou

134
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,916
what is enlightenment Zhaozhou replied

135
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,291
have you eaten your rice porridge

136
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,708
the monk said yes

137
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,958
Zhaozhou said then wash your bowl

138
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,083
that's it no profound philosophy

139
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,291
no mystical vision just washing your bowl

140
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,916
being completely present

141
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,750
with the most ordinary activity

142
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,833
even the Buddha himself challenged the mystical view

143
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,458
in the Kalama Sutta he said

144
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,000
don't believe something

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,208
just because it's passed down by tradition

146
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,250
don't believe something just because I said it

147
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,583
test everything against your own experience

148
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,291
he wasn't asking for blind faith

149
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,250
in some magical transformation

150
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,666
the most enlightened teachers often seem

151
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,250
well disappointingly normal

152
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,041
they get hungry they get tired

153
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,666
they laugh at jokes

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,500
as the 20th century Zen master Shunryu Suzuki put it

155
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,125
if you think you're enlightened

156
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,000
that's a sure sign you're not true

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,625
awakening comes with humility

158
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,291
not grandiosity in our video about Buddhist myths

159
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,291
we talked about misconceptions around Buddhist practice

160
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,333
but this might be the biggest one

161
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:11,708
Enlightenment

162
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,125
isn't an achievement that makes you special

163
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,958
it's the recognition that you were never separate

164
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:20,291
in the first place it's not adding something new

165
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,333
it's removing

166
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,958
the illusions that cloud your natural awareness

167
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,083
the Thai forest monk Ajahn Chah described it beautifully

168
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,583
looking for peace is like looking for a turtle

169
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,333
with a mustache you won't find it

170
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,000
but when your heart is ready

171
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,000
peace will come looking for you

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,708
the shocking truth about enlightenment

173
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,041
isn't how extraordinary it is

174
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:47,125
but how extraordinarily ordinary

175
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,083
here's where things get really interesting

176
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,750
there's a paradox at the heart of spiritual practice

177
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,291
the more desperately you want enlightenment

178
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,125
the more it slips away from you

179
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:06,666
this is what I call the Enlightenment trap

180
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,833
think about it you start meditating to find peace

181
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,166
but then you're checking your progress constantly

182
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,958
am I enlightened yet

183
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:16,916
how about now

184
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:18,458
was that it

185
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,833
you're turning your practice into another achievement

186
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,125
for your ego another way to feel special

187
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,791
but enlightenment isn't something your ego can possess

188
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:32,333
it's the dropping away of ego identification

189
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,375
this connects directly to

190
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,833
one of Buddhism's most profound insights

191
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,375
anatta or non self

192
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,250
the Buddha taught that what we consider ourself

193
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,458
isn't a fixed permanent entity

194
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:48,125
but a process a flowing collection of experiences

195
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:51,125
perceptions thoughts and feelings

196
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,750
enlightenment involves

197
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,416
seeing through the illusion of a separate

198
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:58,083
solid self as the Mahayana sutras put it

199
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:02,000
form is emptiness emptiness is form

200
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,916
you don't lose your identity in awakening

201
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,625
you see it for what it truly is open

202
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,375
interconnected and constantly changing

203
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,916
this isn't abstract philosophy

204
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,125
it's liberation from the prison of a fixed identity

205
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,625
no wonder the Buddha described as awakening

206
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,083
as breaking free from chains

207
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,375
I see this on meditation retreats all the time

208
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,916
people competing for who can sit the longest

209
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,958
who has the deepest insights

210
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,750
who can be the most spiritual

211
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,833
one person experiences a moment of bliss and thinks

212
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,000
I've got it

213
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,291
another has a vision and believes they're chosen

214
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,666
but genuine awakening can't be captured

215
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,833
or owned this way

216
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,583
The 13th century Zen master Dogen warned about this

217
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,208
he said to study the Buddha way is to study the self

218
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,750
to study the self is to forget the self

219
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:55,500
but

220
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,083
how many of us are actually trying to forget ourselves

221
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,166
most of us are trying to improve ourselves

222
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,083
to become a better

223
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:07,083
more spiritual version of who we already think we are

224
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,333
this trap gets even more dangerous

225
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,333
when teachers and gurus fall into it

226
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,625
history is filled with self proclaimed

227
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,833
enlightened masters

228
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,333
who used their status to manipulate followers

229
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,958
they claimed special knowledge or powers

230
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,041
demanded complete obedience

231
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,333
even abused their students trust

232
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,166
as the Buddha himself cautioned in the Kalama Sutta

233
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,125
don't go by reports by legends

234
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,416
by traditions by scripture

235
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,000
by logical conjecture by inference

236
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,875
by analogies by agreement

237
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,958
through pondering views

238
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,291
by probability or by the thought

239
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,125
this contemplative is our teacher

240
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,833
the dark side of the Enlightenment trap

241
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,291
is what psychologists now call

242
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,791
spiritual bypassing

243
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,958
using spiritual ideas to avoid dealing with challenges

244
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,833
I'm so enlightened

245
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,250
I don't need to address my harmful behaviour

246
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:03,625
everything is empty so my actions don't matter

247
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,666
this misses the point entirely

248
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,458
true awakening increases responsibility

249
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,666
and ethical awareness not decreases it

250
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,416
remember this simple truth

251
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,541
those who claim enlightenment most loudly are usually

252
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:22,000
furthest from it as the Tao Te Ching puts it

253
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
those who know do not speak

254
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,333
those who speak do not know

255
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,083
the moment you believe you're enlightened

256
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,625
you've fallen into the trap

257
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,541
this romanticization of enlightenment has exploded

258
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,333
in our modern consumer culture

259
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,000
we've turned awakening into another product

260
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,250
another experience to collect

261
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,208
you see this in wellness retreats

262
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,875
promising enlightenment in a weekend

263
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,041
or apps

264
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,916
claiming to deliver ancient wisdom without the work

265
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,041
true

266
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:54,166
practice isn't about accumulating special experiences

267
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,625
it's about seeing through

268
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,375
the very desire for special experiences

269
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:02,041
this romanticization becomes especially dangerous

270
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,291
when it leads to spiritual bypassing

271
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:08,291
I've witnessed meditators dismiss real world problems

272
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,333
with phrases like it's all just emptiness

273
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,166
or everything is perfect as it is

274
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,666
while ignoring ethical responsibilities

275
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,375
the Buddha never taught that awakening means

276
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:23,166
escaping reality quite the opposite

277
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,166
it means facing reality more directly

278
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,208
with greater responsibility not less

279
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,416
so what does enlightenment look like in today's world

280
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,458
scientists have actually been studying this question

281
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,541
for decades they've put long time meditators

282
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,625
and Buddhist monks into brain scanners

283
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,041
and what they found is fascinating

284
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:48,791
these

285
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,500
advanced practitioners show distinctive brain patterns

286
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,250
increased gamma waves

287
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,750
more activity in the prefrontal cortex

288
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,000
less reactivity in the amygdala

289
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,333
reduced activity in what's called

290
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,958
the default mode network

291
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,416
the part responsible for self referential thinking

292
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,958
in other words their brains physically change

293
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,541
let me share something funny that happened

294
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,791
at a silent meditation retreat I attended

295
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,875
on day 5 someone had this

296
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,333
profound experience during meditation

297
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,625
their face was glowing they were floating on air

298
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:23,541
then at lunch

299
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,083
someone took the last dessert they wanted and boom

300
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,583
instant rage

301
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,416
we all do this

302
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,375
we have a moment of clarity in meditation

303
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,250
then lose it when life happens

304
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:39,375
but here's the thing that's not a failure of practice

305
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,583
that IS the practice

306
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,250
noticing how quickly we go from Buddha to Hulk

307
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,250
is exactly what awareness is for

308
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,333
as one teacher joked Enlightenment

309
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,750
isn't when you stop getting angry about traffic

310
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,666
it's when you see yourself getting angry and think ah

311
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,000
there's that pattern again

312
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,750
and maybe laugh at yourself a little

313
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,750
but here's the critical question

314
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,500
can a brain scan detect enlightenment

315
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,875
can science measure awakening

316
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,166
many researchers now believe the answer is no

317
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,208
as neuroscientist Richard Davidson puts it

318
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:17,875
we can measure correlates of meditation

319
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:22,541
but consciousness itself remains a scientific mystery

320
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:27,291
the finger pointing at the moon is not the moon itself

321
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,208
what's even more interesting

322
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,833
is how enlightenment manifests in everyday people

323
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,375
you don't need to be a monk in a monastery

324
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,250
a parent changing diapers

325
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,250
can be just as awakened

326
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,083
as someone meditating in a cave

327
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,791
a programmer writing code

328
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,791
can be just as present as someone chanting mantras

329
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,916
I spoke with several teachers for this video

330
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,833
and they all emphasize the same point

331
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,500
Enlightenment isn't about escaping your life

332
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,875
it's about being fully present within it

333
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,416
the awakened mind brings clarity to whatever touches

334
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,791
relationships work

335
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,000
creativity even struggle

336
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,750
think about everyday situations

337
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,583
how would an enlightened person handle

338
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,000
getting cut off in traffic

339
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,291
they might feel a flash of anger

340
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,916
but it wouldn't consume them

341
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,041
how would they deal with illness

342
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,125
They'd face pain directly

343
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,416
without adding the suffering of resistance

344
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,916
how would they approach success

345
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,750
with appreciation but without grasping

346
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,500
as one contemporary teacher told me

347
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,291
enlightenment isn't locked in a monastery

348
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
it's found in how you treat others

349
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,083
your patience in traffic

350
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,458
and the presence you bring to each moment

351
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:42,250
the Buddha himself was constantly engaged with society

352
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,416
teaching traveling resolving conflicts

353
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,208
it's fascinating

354
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,958
how enlightenment is understood differently

355
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,208
across cultures

356
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,041
in traditional eastern contexts

357
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,333
awakening is often seen as

358
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,291
realizing what's already present

359
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,750
your Buddha nature

360
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,208
it's removing obstacles to what's natural

361
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,708
but when these teachings migrated to the west

362
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,833
they often merged with our achievement oriented mindset

363
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,166
western seekers

364
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,875
frequently approach enlightenment as something to gain

365
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,416
accomplish or add to themselves

366
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,041
the psychology professor Jack Cornfield

367
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:22,041
calls this the spiritual materialism of the west

368
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,500
neither of you is entirely wrong

369
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,041
but the traditional eastern approach

370
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,125
might save us from turning enlightenment

371
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,416
into another item on our spiritual shopping list

372
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,916
as the Vietnamese Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh said

373
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,583
we are here to awaken

374
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,750
from the illusion of our separateness

375
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,416
not to acquire something we lack

376
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,875
modern manifestations of enlightenment are practical

377
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,500
you notice it in someone's actions

378
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,708
more than their words in their consistent kindness

379
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,625
in their capacity to stay balanced under pressure

380
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
in their ability to see clearly

381
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,458
without being swept away by emotions

382
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,125
these qualities don't make for flashy Instagram posts

383
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,625
but they're far more valuable

384
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:09,750
now

385
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,333
we come to one of Buddhism's most beautiful concepts

386
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,625
the Bodhisattva path a Bodhisattva

387
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,208
is someone who could reach complete enlightenment

388
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,541
but makes an extraordinary choice

389
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,625
they vow to remain in the cycle of rebirth

390
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,041
to help all beings end their suffering

391
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,500
it's the ultimate act of compassion

392
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,750
as we covered in our video

393
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,000
why everyone needs to know about bodhisattvas

394
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,000
this ideal

395
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,666
completely transforms how we view enlightenment

396
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,958
instead of seeking liberation for yourself alone

397
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:40,958
you recognize

398
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,166
the true freedom comes through connection with others

399
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,208
the Bodhisattva makes a radical promise

400
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,875
expressed in these powerful words from the tradition

401
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,875
may I be a guard for those who need Protection

402
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,958
a guide for those on the path

403
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,291
a boat a raft

404
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,958
a bridge for those who wish to cross the flood

405
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,208
may I be a lamp in the darkness

406
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,333
a resting place for the weary

407
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,250
a healing medicine for all who are sick

408
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:10,041
a vase of plenty a tree of miracles

409
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:12,833
what's fascinating is

410
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,375
how this path changes our relationship with suffering

411
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,416
when you're only focused on escaping your own pain

412
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,333
suffering remains the enemy

413
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,041
but for a bodhisattva

414
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,708
suffering becomes the catalyst for compassion

415
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,291
your own difficulties

416
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,166
help you understand what others feel

417
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,708
your challenges become your teachers

418
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,875
The Heart Sutra one of Buddhism's most important texts

419
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,041
contains the essence of this wisdom

420
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva

421
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,458
practicing deep Prajna Paramita

422
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,500
clearly saw that all 5 skandhas are empty

423
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,875
transforming all suffering in distress

424
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,041
this doesn't mean suffering disappears

425
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,208
it means you see its true nature

426
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,250
and are no longer controlled by it

427
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,458
I find this especially relevant in today's world

428
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,833
we're constantly bombarded with messages about

429
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,250
personal success and individual happiness

430
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,208
but the body thought the path

431
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,125
reminds us that true fulfillment

432
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,875
comes through service and connection

433
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,916
true enlightenment isn't a private achievement

434
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,458
it naturally flows outward to benefit others

435
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,250
as the 14th Dalai Lama says

436
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,083
our prime purpose in this life is to help others

437
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,750
and if you can't help them

438
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,500
at least don't hurt them

439
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,583
this simple statement

440
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,916
captures the practical ethics of awakening

441
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,333
it's not about reaching some exalted state

442
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,041
it's about how you treat the person

443
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,666
right in front of you right now

444
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,250
but if the Bodhisattva

445
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,708
 path is about how enlightenment moves outward

446
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,916
how does it arise in the first place

447
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,666
slowly over years or all at once

448
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,000
throughout Buddhist history

449
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,791
there's been a fascinating debate

450
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,958
does enlightenment happen in a flash of insight

451
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,416
or through gradual development over time

452
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,583
different traditions have strong opinions about this

453
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,625
in Zen and Chan Buddhism

454
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,208
teachers often emphasize sudden enlightenment

455
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,083
they speak of satori

456
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,833
a moment of breakthrough when everything shifts

457
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,250
the classic Zen stories love these dramatic awakenings

458
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,250
like when Kyogen was sweeping

459
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,500
and a tile hit bamboo with a sharp crack

460
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,458
in that sound his mind opened completely

461
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,208
or when Hakuin heard a temple bell

462
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,125
and suddenly understood meanwhile

463
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,250
the Theravada tradition

464
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,583
generally teaches a more gradual approach

465
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,375
they outline specific stages of insight that unfolds

466
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,458
step by step first comes moral discipline

467
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,208
then concentration then wisdom emerges

468
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,750
The Visuddhimagga a fifth century Buddhist text

469
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,791
maps out 16 distinct insight knowledges

470
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,833
that develop in sequence so who's right

471
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,166
the sudden school or the gradual school

472
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,666
here's where it gets interesting

473
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,916
maybe both are true simultaneously

474
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,625
The 9th century Chan master

475
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,375
Guifeng Zongmi offered a brilliant solution

476
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,500
he said Enlightenment is sudden

477
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,541
but its expression is gradual

478
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,500
it's like the sun rising

479
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,458
the sun itself emerges suddenly above the horizon

480
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,250
but it gradually illuminates the landscape

481
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,250
one moment you're in darkness

482
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,833
then there's light

483
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,958
but it takes time to see everything clearly

484
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,208
this matches

485
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,958
the experience of many practitioners I've spoken with

486
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,625
they describe moments of profound insight

487
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,666
followed by years of integrating that understanding

488
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,500
as one teacher told me

489
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,083
awakening can happen in an instant

490
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,333
but embodying it takes a lifetime

491
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,708
the Buddha himself seem to acknowledge both paths

492
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,500
in some sutras he describes gradual training

493
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,750
in others he tells stories of immediate awakening

494
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,041
his first disciples reached enlightenment

495
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,291
to different speeds

496
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,583
some took years others understood immediately

497
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,041
what matters isn't the timeline

498
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:58,000
but the authenticity as the Buddha didn't say

499
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,291
I am enlightened he said

500
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,500
I am awake

501
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,375
the journey isn't to become something else

502
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,416
but to wake up to what you already

503
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,208
are

504
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,125
sometimes that happens gradually

505
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,083
as the morning light fills a room

506
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,250
other times it happens suddenly

507
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,041
like flipping on a light switch

508
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,500
but either way what matters is seeing clearly

509
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,875
we've traveled quite a path together in this video

510
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,333
from the Buddha's awakening under the Bodie Tree

511
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,000
to the ways

512
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,291
enlightenment manifests in our modern world

513
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,083
so what have we discovered

514
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,750
Enlightenment isn't what most people think

515
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,666
it's not gaining special powers

516
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,750
it's not escaping your problems

517
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,833
it's not becoming someone else

518
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,250
it's seeing reality clearly

519
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,708
just as it is without the distortions of craving

520
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,416
aversion and delusion

521
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,750
the great mystery of awakening is this paradox

522
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,875
the external world remains exactly the same

523
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,041
yet everything is transformed

524
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,458
as one teacher put it

525
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,583
enlightenment isn't a cosmic fireworks display

526
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,458
it's simply removing the blinders

527
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:07,000
you never knew you were wearing

528
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:10,500
nothing changes yet everything is different

529
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:12,833
if there's

530
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,416
one thing to take away from our exploration today

531
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:16,416
it's this

532
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,750
don't chase enlightenment as another achievement

533
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:23,000
that's just the ego playing spiritual games

534
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:26,750
instead practice with sincerity

535
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,291
be present with whatever arises

536
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,333
cultivate compassion for yourself and others

537
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,583
the rest will unfold naturally

538
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:38,458
remember enlightenment isn't found in a temple

539
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,041
a text or a technique

540
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,750
it is the silent awareness behind every breath

541
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,083
the moment you stop searching for it

542
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,625
it has already arrived

543
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,166
as always I'd love to hear your thoughts and questions

00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,458
in the comments below

545
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,708
have you experienced moments of clarity

546
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:56,041
in your own practice what obstacles do

547
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:59,083
you face what teachings have helped you the most
