1
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,041
imagine being there the day Buddha died

2
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,958
500 of his closest disciples gather

3
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,208
knowing they have to remember everything he taught

4
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:19,125
over 45 years no phones

5
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:22,083
no writing nothing but their memories

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,750
one monk stands up and says

7
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,625
I remember it this way

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,750
another argues no

9
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,458
that's not what he said at all

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,458
now fast forward 2,500 years

11
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,541
Buddhist scholars make a shocking discovery

12
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:40,916
we might have lost

13
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:43,291
more than half of Buddha's original teachings

14
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,833
entire collections of wisdom vanished

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,708
sacred instructions gone forever

16
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,500
and the most fascinating part

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,083
we're just now finding clues

18
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,500
about what these lost teachings contained

19
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:00,666
these discoveries

20
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:03,166
are transforming our understanding of Buddhism

21
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,750
what archaeologists found in hidden caves

22
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,583
and buried temples reveals an unexpected picture

23
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,250
of Buddha's original message

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,708
let me share something remarkable

25
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:16,125
this is one of the oldest Buddhist texts ever found

26
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:20,125
written in ancient Gāndhārī language

27
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,500
on birchbark around the 1st century BCE

28
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,625
these scrolls were discovered in clay pots

29
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,666
buried in Afghanistan and they contain teachings

30
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,958
nobody has seen for thousands of years

31
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,166
here's the wild part

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,875
for 400 years after Buddha died

33
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,666
nobody wrote anything down

34
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,625
everything was memorized

35
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:44,083
like trying to remember every single Marvel movie

36
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,166
word for word

37
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,791
now multiply that by a thousand

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,083
it wasn't until 25 BCE

39
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,250
that monks in Sri Lanka first wrote down

40
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,208
what we now call

41
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,625
from India to China from deserts to mountain peaks

42
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,083
Buddha's words spread across Asia

43
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,458
but with each new translation

44
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,666
with each new generation something was lost

45
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,750
teachings disappeared

46
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,333
entire schools of Buddhism vanished

47
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:14,625
ancient libraries

48
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,583
like those containing the Gilgit manuscripts

49
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,333
were destroyed or abandoned

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,250
today we're piecing together this ancient puzzle

51
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,291
will explore

52
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,500
what got left out of Buddhism's first council

53
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,333
the lost voices of Buddhism's women masters

54
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,333
mysterious practices that vanished centuries ago

55
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:37,083
and recent discoveries transforming our understanding

56
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,958
quick heads up though

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,375
some of this stuff is rock solid history

58
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,000
backed by archaeology and ancient texts

59
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,000
other parts total mystery

60
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:52,041
don't worry I'll let you know which is which as we go

61
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,625
get ready because the Buddha you think you know

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,500
might not be the Buddha that actually existed

63
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,708
the crisis started when Buddha took his final breath

64
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,333
his last words echoed in the air

65
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,291
those words would become strangely true

66
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,500
for his own teachings

67
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,875
three months after Buddha's death

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,166
500 monks gathered in a massive cave near Rajagaha

69
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,166
this isn't some legend we have the cave

70
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:27,833
we have the texts we have proof this gathering happened

71
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:28,916
their mission?

72
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,166
remember and preserve every single teaching Buddha gave

73
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,666
over 45 years

74
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,958
but something unexpected happened

75
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:40,791
the monks almost banned Ananda from this gathering

76
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,333
yes

77
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,583
Buddha's closest disciple

78
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,000
his personal attendant for decades

79
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:48,750
the one person

80
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,875
who heard more teachings than anyone else

81
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,208
almost excluded

82
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:54,708
why?

83
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,166
because he wasn't fully enlightened yet

84
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,500
while most monks grieved one monk saw an opportunity

85
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,833
his name was Subhadda and what he

86
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,000
said

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
is actually written down in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta

88
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,291
one of our oldest Buddhist texts

89
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,500
ready for this

90
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,166
he stood up and told everyone

91
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,958
can you believe that?

92
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,541
the ink wasn't even dry on Buddha's legacy

93
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,625
and already someone was ready to change the rules

94
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,833
this one moment shows exactly why

95
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,458
the monks needed to preserve Buddha's exact words

96
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,125
and why they spent 7 months

97
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,416
trying to get everything right

98
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,333
for 7 months these monks debated

99
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,875
they recited they argued about what Buddha really meant

100
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,916
but here's the million dollar question

101
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,500
what did they leave out?

102
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,000
what teachings got voted off the island?

103
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,416
some monks thought certain teachings were too wild

104
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:09,291
too radical too mind bending for regular people

105
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,541
so they just disappeared

106
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,291
recent discoveries in Afghanistan and Pakistan

107
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,500
might hold the answer

108
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,250
archaeologists found fragments of Buddhist text

109
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,708
that never made it into any official collection

110
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,666
these ancient scrolls tell a very different story

111
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,666
about Buddha's original message

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,458
stuff that somehow got left out of the final cut

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,625
think about it the Buddhism we know today

114
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,166
might be like watching a movie

115
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,125
but missing half the scenes

116
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,166
and we're just now finding the deleted footage

117
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,458
imagine trying to remember every

118
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,833
word of your favorite movie

119
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,750
now imagine remembering thousands of teachings

120
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,583
word for word for 400 years

121
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,750
that's exactly what Buddhist monks had to do

122
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,750
because after Buddha died

123
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:02,666
no one wrote down his teachings for four centuries

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,583
here's what's fascinating

125
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,000
we know

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,583
exactly when Buddhist started writing things down

127
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,750
it happened during the reign of King Vattagamani

128
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,000
in Sri Lanka around 25 BCE

129
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,708
the result became the Pāli Canon

130
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,500
but why wait so long?

131
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,000
there was this massive famine hitting Sri Lanka

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,083
monks were starving dying

133
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,583
and they realized something terrifying

134
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,708
if all the monks who memorized the teachings died

135
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,041
Buddha's words would disappear forever

136
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,041
so they did something revolutionary

137
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,000
they grabbed their palm leaves and started writing

138
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,916
but something unexpected happened

139
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,583
during those 400 years

140
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,041
each generation of monks remembered things

141
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,375
slightly differently

142
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,916
think of it like a game of telephone

143
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,166
but played across centuries and continents

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,166
we can prove this happen because

145
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,500
we have different versions of the same teachings

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,625
some from Sri Lanka some from China

147
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:01,958
some from Tibet

148
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:06,500
they tell the same stories but with crucial differences

149
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,000
take the Buddhist famous first sermon

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,958
we have 17 different versions

151
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,750
each one slightly different

152
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,500
each one preserving unique details while losing others

153
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:21,000
scholars recently discovered that some versions include

154
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,333
meditation instructions

155
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,000
that are completely missing from others

156
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,166
instructions that could have changed

157
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,500
how millions practice Buddhism today

158
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,291
and here's what's really mind bending

159
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,166
we're still finding pieces of this puzzle

160
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,708
in 1994 archaeologist

161
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,666
discovered a collection of ancient scrolls

162
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,791
in Afghanistan

163
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,000
written in a language that took years to translate

164
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,166
these scrolls contain Buddhist teachings

165
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,708
we've never seen before teachings that somehow got lost

166
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,458
during those 400 years of oral transmission

167
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,333
modern Buddhist practice meditation

168
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,250
following very specific steps

169
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,375
but there's something strange

170
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,583
the oldest Buddhist texts

171
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,458
rarely explain how to meditate

172
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,250
it's as if someone removed the instruction manual

173
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,458
leaving only the theory behind

174
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,708
we know Buddha taught different methods

175
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,833
to different people

176
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,791
a merchant once asked Buddha

177
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,791
how to meditate while running his business

178
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,541
a warrior asked how to stay mindful in battle

179
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,375
a mother asked how to practice with young children

180
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:32,166
their question survived but Buddha's answers gone

181
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,083
poof vanished

182
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,708
but sometimes archaeologists get lucky

183
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:41,583
in the 1990s they found these ancient scrolls in China

184
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,666
it contained thousands of Buddhist texts

185
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,708
from the 4th to 11th centuries

186
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:51,666
and they had something amazing

187
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,166
actual instructions from Buddha

188
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,166
like his specific advice for dealing with anger

189
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,375
and guess what it's totally different

190
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,625
from what Buddha's teachers tell us today

191
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,583
let's talk about what we know we lost

192
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,333
ancient texts mentioned

193
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,625
Buddha gave personal teachings to kings

194
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,833
to merchants to farmers

195
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,250
to children each teaching tailored to their lives

196
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,333
but these teachings vanished

197
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,000
we only have brief mentions that they existed

198
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,666
like chapter titles in a book

199
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,375
where all the pages are missing

200
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,458
even more intriguing

201
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:30,333
Chinese pilgrims who visited India around 400 C E

202
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,291
wrote about

203
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,916
seeing collections of Buddha's personal teachings

204
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,416
they described scrolls

205
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,625
containing Buddha's private conversations

206
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,791
his daily advice

207
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,083
his answers to life's deepest questions

208
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,750
but by the time they returned to copy these texts

209
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,916
all those libraries destroyed

210
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,708
all those teachings gone forever

211
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,791
these weren't just any teachings

212
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,500
they were Buddha's direct words to real people

213
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,666
facing real problems just like us

214
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,250
imagine finding Buddha's advice about family life

215
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,833
about business ethics

216
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,875
about dealing with difficult people

217
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,125
all lost

218
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,625
yet sometimes in remote monasteries and hidden caves

219
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,833
we find fragments tiny pieces of Buddha's lost wisdom

220
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,166
showing us just how much we're missing

221
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,625
okay this one's wild

222
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:29,833
did you know

223
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,666
Buddha's first female student was actually his stepmom

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,666
her name was Mahaprajapati

225
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,583
and she started a straight up revolution

226
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,541
by becoming the first Buddhist nun

227
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,541
but almost everything she taught disappeared

228
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:46,500
four centuries of wisdom from Buddhist women gone

229
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,666
we know these women existed

230
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:52,625
ancient texts mention over 500 enlightened nuns

231
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,750
but while their names survived

232
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,541
their words disappeared

233
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,583
all except for one tiny collection of poems

234
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:00,666
called

235
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:03,958
think about that

236
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,958
thousands of women teachers

237
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,291
but only one book of poems remains

238
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,375
in 2019 archaeologist made an incredible discovery

239
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,833
hidden in an ancient library in Tibet

240
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,000
they found fragments of teachings from Buddhist nuns

241
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,125
these weren't just spiritual poems

242
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,333
they were practical instructions

243
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,208
different ways of teaching

244
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,250
different approaches to Enlightenment

245
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,791
methods that had been forgotten for centuries

246
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,333
let me tell you about Khema

247
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,583
she was a queen who became a Buddhist nun

248
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,333
ancient texts say she was

249
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,541
equal to Buddha's greatest male disciples

250
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,208
she had a unique way of teaching

251
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,875
that even impressed kings

252
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,208
but today

253
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:51,958
we only have one conversation of hers that survived

254
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,666
just one

255
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,958
everything else she taught

256
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,833
gone

257
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,791
recent studies of Buddhist cave paintings

258
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,375
show something unexpected

259
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,791
images of women teaching

260
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,875
large groups of both men and women

261
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,000
these paintings tell a different story than our texts

262
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:09,833
they show

263
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,125
women had a much bigger role in early Buddhism

264
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,083
than we thought so what happened to their teachings

265
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,750
why did they disappear

266
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,416
some scholars think these

267
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,583
teachings were deliberately removed

268
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,583
others believe they were simply lost over time

269
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,500
but one thing's clear

270
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,500
we lost an entire perspective on Buddhism

271
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,250
a way of teaching

272
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,166
that might have made Buddhism very different today

273
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,916
remember those self help books

274
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,333
filling bookstore shelves

275
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,541
Buddha was giving similar

276
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,583
practical advice 2,500 years ago

277
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,208
ancient texts mention

278
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,833
he taught special breathing techniques

279
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:54,000
for healing methods for dealing with chronic pain

280
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,250
even practices for better sleep

281
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,416
but these teachings completely gone

282
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,791
here's a mysterious example

283
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,208
in northern India archaeologists found

284
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,375
medical manuscripts from Buddha's time

285
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,041
they describe Buddha teaching something called

286
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,333
body scanning

287
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,125
a technique he apparently

288
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,625
used to help people with physical and mental problems

289
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,625
but the actual instructions lost

290
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,125
modern Buddhist

291
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,458
had to reinvent these practices from scratch

292
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:24,958
the Chinese pilgrim

293
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,958
Xuanzang wrote about visiting a monastery in India

294
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,083
where monks preserved Buddhist teachings

295
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,291
about daily life

296
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:35,291
instructions for everything from resolving conflicts

297
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,333
to maintaining relationships

298
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,541
to dealing with difficult emotions

299
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,208
he planned to translate these texts

300
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,458
but before he could return

301
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,625
the monastery was destroyed

302
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,041
but sometimes we get lucky

303
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:53,458
in 2001 researchers in Afghanistan found scrolls

304
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,583
containing practical Buddhist teachings

305
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,708
they included instructions we'd never seen before

306
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,125
like specific meditation techniques

307
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,833
for different personality types

308
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,166
and detailed guidance for balancing spiritual practice

309
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,041
with daily responsibilities

310
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,541
think about what this means

311
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,583
we know Buddha spent 45 years

312
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,541
teaching people how to live better lives

313
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,875
he must have given thousands of practical instructions

314
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,125
but today

315
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,125
we only have a tiny fraction of these teachings

316
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,791
the rest

317
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,416
hidden in caves we haven't found

318
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,166
buried in deserts we haven't explored

319
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,750
or simply lost forever

320
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,166
in 1994

321
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,500
a Shepherd in northern Afghanistan stumbled into a cave

322
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,500
what he found changed Buddhist history forever

323
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:49,541
the Gandhāran

324
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:53,041
scrolls written in ancient Gāndhārī language

325
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,208
these weren't just any scrolls

326
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,666
they were some of the oldest Buddhist manuscripts

327
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:01,083
ever found dating to the 1st century BCE

328
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,416
when scholars finally translated them

329
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,916
they found Buddhist teachings

330
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,750
different from the Pāli Canon

331
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,958
these scrolls contain Buddhist teachings

332
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,333
no one had ever seen

333
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,625
different forms of meditation

334
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,833
unknown stories about Buddha

335
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,125
and most surprisingly teachings that

336
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,291
contradicted everything we thought we knew

337
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,041
for example

338
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,000
one scroll described a

339
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,250
form of meditation that didn't focus on breathing

340
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,083
at all instead

341
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,750
it taught something completely different

342
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,291
in the Bamyan Valley of Afghanistan

343
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,666
you know where those giant Buddha statues used to be

344
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,291
archaeologists found something even more incredible

345
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,916
buried beneath an ancient monastery

346
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,958
they discovered a library

347
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,958
the manuscripts inside

348
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,750
revealed that early Buddhists had different

349
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,208
ideas about enlightenment

350
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,250
they didn't think it would take many lifetimes

351
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,000
they believed it was possible in a single life

352
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:04,166
then 2017

353
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:09,166
another bombshell in a remote cave in Tibet

354
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,125
researchers found a collection of manuscripts

355
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,541
that mentioned Buddha's lost healing practices

356
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,166
these weren't just spiritual teachings

357
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,750
they were practical methods

358
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,208
for treating both physical and mental illness

359
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,500
methods that modern science is just now

360
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,875
beginning to understand

361
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,916
every year new technology helps us uncover more

362
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,458
scientists now

363
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,750
use artificial intelligence

364
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,458
to read damaged manuscripts

365
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:34,791
special cameras

366
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,416
reveal text that's invisible to human eyes

367
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,541
and underground

368
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,666
radar finds buried monasteries we never knew existed

369
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,166
each discovery shows us

370
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,750
how much of Buddha's original teachings

371
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,500
we lost and how much we might still find

372
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,458
ever wonder why different Buddhist teachers give

373
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,250
completely different instructions

374
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,916
why some say meditation should be hard

375
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,791
while others say it should be easy

376
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,708
the answer might lie in the teachings we lost

377
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,291
the missing pieces that could bridge these gaps

378
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,083
let's get real

379
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,375
you're trying to practice Buddhism while juggling a job

380
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,375
maybe kids Netflix subscriptions

381
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,666
the traditional texts don't say much about this stuff

382
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,750
but we know Buddha taught thousands of regular people

383
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,791
people with jobs and families just like us

384
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,458
their questions were probably exactly like ours

385
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,500
but Buddha's answers

386
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,250
lost in time

387
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,583
modern science has proven

388
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,125
meditation can reduce stress and anxiety

389
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,125
but researchers discovered something strange

390
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,208
some people actually feel worse when they meditate

391
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,416
ancient texts hint that Buddha knew about this

392
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,958
he gave different practices to different people

393
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,625
but these specific instructions disappeared

394
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,541
now everyone's just guessing what works

395
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,958
look at mindfulness it's everywhere now

396
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,500
your phone probably has a mindfulness app

397
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:02,958
but check this out

398
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,416
recently

399
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,750
discovered fragments show Buddha taught mindfulness

400
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,000
totally differently

401
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,791
he had specific techniques for different situations

402
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,125
different approaches for different minds

403
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,375
this could solve so many problems

404
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,291
people have with meditation today

405
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,541
and here's what really matters

406
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,916
we're finding clues about lost teachings

407
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,583
that could help with modern issues

408
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,500
scrolls talking about dealing with addiction

409
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,208
managing relationships handling money ethically

410
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,333
the exact challenges we face today

411
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,166
Buddha address these problems

412
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:38,416
but his specific guidance scattered across time

413
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,916
buried in ruins or completely vanished

414
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,000
few people know that

415
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,166
Afghanistan was once the heart of Buddhism

416
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,125
thousands of monasteries dotted its mountains

417
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,625
each one preserving unique teachings

418
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,791
but they didn't just disappear

419
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,416
they were lost in waves of destruction

420
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:04,625
first by invasion then by time itself

421
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,500
today

422
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,791
only ruins remain

423
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,000
in Pakistan's ancient region of Gundhara

424
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,000
Buddhist universities once rivaled modern Oxford

425
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,833
or Harvard

426
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,125
this is where the Gilgit Manuscripts were discovered

427
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,916
a treasure trove of Buddhist texts

428
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,500
from the 6th and 7th centuries CE

429
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,333
written on birch bark and palm leaves

430
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,750
they showed how Buddhism evolved

431
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,291
as it spread across Asia

432
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,541
students traveled from China

433
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,625
Korea and Japan to study there

434
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,625
they had vast libraries original teachings

435
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,666
unique traditions but war after war erased them

436
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,291
texts were burned monasteries destroyed

437
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,041
entire traditions vanished overnight

438
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,250
Indonesia holds a shocking secret

439
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,541
the world's largest Buddhist temple

440
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,083
Borobudur stands there

441
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,166
but the tradition that built it

442
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,833
completely gone imagine that

443
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,291
a civilization

444
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,916
advanced enough to build this massive Monument

445
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,375
had their own unique Buddhist teachings

446
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,958
their own interpretations

447
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,916
all lost to time

448
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,666
Central Asia tells an even stranger story

449
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,958
in the desert sands of the Silk Road

450
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,083
archaeologists found Buddhist texts

451
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,750
written in forgotten languages

452
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,625
these communities had their own

453
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,000
unique blend of Buddhism

454
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,166
different from anything we practiced today

455
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,166
they survived for centuries in the harsh desert

456
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,625
then simply vanished

457
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,958
the strangest part

458
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,041
each of these lost Buddhist lands

459
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,125
had their own collection of Buddhist teachings

460
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,083
their own unique practices

461
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,583
their own understanding when they disappeared

462
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,333
they took entire versions of Buddhism with them

463
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,916
versions were only now starting to rediscover

464
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,375
what did Buddha say in his final moments?

465
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,791
the texts tell us his last words

466
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,333
but ancient sources mention

467
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,083
he gave special instructions

468
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,500
secret teachings for the future

469
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,333
instructions so important

470
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,416
that monks guarded them for centuries

471
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,458
yet somehow they vanished

472
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,375
here's a mystery that haunts Buddha scholars

473
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,041
Buddha predicted his teachings would disappear

474
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,458
not immediately but gradually over thousands of years

475
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:25,250
but

476
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,333
he also left specific instructions for preserving them

477
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,291
instructions that were supposedly hidden away

478
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,791
waiting to be discovered at the right time

479
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,333
some believe we've already lost them

480
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:40,166
others think they're still out there waiting

481
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,250
the biggest mystery involves a prophecy

482
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,166
ancient text mentioned Buddha

483
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,416
spoke about a future Buddha named Maitreya

484
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,333
and if you watched our video

485
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,666
"who is Maitreya?" you already know how big this is

486
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,666
but here's something we didn't cover in that video

487
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,500
Buddha gave specific teachings to be preserved

488
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,708
for this future teacher some say

489
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,083
these teachings were carved into copper scrolls

490
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,791
and hidden in the Himalayas

491
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,625
others claim they were taken to a hidden kingdom

492
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,375
but no one has ever found them

493
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,458
then there's the mystery of Buddha's personal items

494
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,041
his bowl his robe

495
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,041
his relics

496
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,750
each one supposedly contained hidden teachings

497
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,666
monks carefully preserved them for centuries

498
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,791
passing them down through generations

499
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,500
but one by one

500
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,250
they disappeared

501
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,416
taking their secrets with them

502
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,958
but the greatest mystery of all

503
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,166
we don't know what we don't know

504
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:37,083
every year archaeologists uncover new evidence

505
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,458
scholars translate new texts

506
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,041
and our picture of Buddhist teachings changes

507
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,541
what else might be out there

508
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,625
hidden in unexplored caves

509
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,375
buried under ancient cities

510
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,750
or lost forever in the sands of time

511
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,208
so here we are

512
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,416
2,500 years after Buddha's death

513
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,458
pieces of his teachings scattered across time

514
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:05,500
lost scrolls still buried in desert caves

515
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,583
ancient manuscripts waiting to be translated

516
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,416
and new discoveries happening every year

517
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,625
maybe that's the most incredible thing about all this

518
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,708
even with so much lost

519
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,833
Buddhism still works

520
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,458
the basic instructions for ending suffering

521
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:23,458
the fundamental path to freedom

522
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:27,583
they survived still helping people after all this time

523
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:28,833
but next time

524
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:29,625
you hear someone claim

525
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,458
they know exactly what Buddha taught

526
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:35,041
remember this we're all working with fragments

527
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:38,250
with echoes of what was once a much bigger teaching

528
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,958
the Buddha we think we know

529
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,208
might be very different from the teacher

530
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,500
who actually walked those dusty roads of India

531
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,375
teaching countless lessons that vanished in time

532
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,958
the search continues in remote caves

533
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:55,000
in desert ruins in forgotten languages

534
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,416
each discovery brings us closer to

535
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,583
understanding Buddha's complete message

536
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,916
but some teachings some mysteries

537
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,416

the greatest teachings lie in what we don't know
