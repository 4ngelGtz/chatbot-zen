the power of the mind it highlights the

19
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:03,600
Dual nature of our thoughts how impure

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,200

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,000
like the wheel that follows the foot of

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,640
the

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,479

46
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,480
law there are those who do not realize

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,879
that one day we all must die but those

48
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,879
who do realize this settle their

49
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:27,959
quarrels just as the wind sweeps away a

50
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:30,800
weak tree so Mara sweeps away the person

51
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:36,239
who lives for pleasure UNC controlled in

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:38,680
senses immoderate in eating lazy and

53
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,000
weak just as the wind cannot shake a

54
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,720
mountain so Mara can never shake the

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,640
person who lives meditating on the

56
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,760
impurities controlled in senses moderate

57
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,680
in eating and filled with faith and

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,319
effort whoever being depraved devoid of

60
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,040
self-control and truthfulness should

00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:01,239
Dawn the yellow robe they surely are not

62
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,480
worthy of it

63
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,680
but whoever is purged of depravity well

64
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,840
established in virtues filled with

65
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,840
self-control and truthfulness they

66
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,360
indeed are worthy of the yellow

67
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:18,239
robe those who imagine truth in untruth

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:21,599
and see untruth in truth never arrive at

69
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,120

72
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,360
and follow true desires

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,720
just as rain breaks through an ill

74
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,239
thatched house so passion penetrates an

75
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,640

76
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,840
mind just as rain does not break through

77
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,680
a well thatched house so passion never

78
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,439
penetrates a well-developed

79
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:51,079

State much though one recites the sacred

99
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,080
texts but acts not accordingly that

100
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,080

practice forsaking lust hatred and

106
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,039
delusion with tr true wisdom and

107
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,080
emancipated mind clinging to nothing of

108
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:09,680
this or any other world one indeed

109
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,680

Chapter 3 The Mind delves into the

168
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,120
complexity and subtlety of our inner

169
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,879
world the Buddha Likens the mind to a

170
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,400
Restless fish or a Fletcher's Arrow

171
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,759
difficult to control but powerful when

172
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,879
tamed these verses remind us to guard

173
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,639
our minds and see it as the gateway to

174
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,520
freedom from

175
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,840
suffering the flickering fickle mind

176
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,360
difficult to guard difficult to control

177
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,440
the wise person straightens as a

178
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,440
Fletcher straightens an arrow

179
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:06,520
like a fish that is drawn from its

180
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,240
watery Abode and thrown upon land even

181
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,759
so does this mind

182
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,120
flutter hence should the realm of the

183
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:16,560
passions be

184
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:20,520
shunned the mind is hard to control

185
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:24,000
Swift and flighty it alights where it

186
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:26,919
wishes good is it to tame the mind for a

187
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
tamed mind brings

188
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:31,639
happiness the mind is very hard to

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,039
perceive extremely subtle a lights

190
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:37,519
wherever it wishes let the wise person

chapter 5 the fool is a cautionary tale

295
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,160
about ignorance and its consequences the

296
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,720
Buddha warns against Foolish Pride

desire for recognition and attachment to

298
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:18,320
worldly gains instead he urges us to

299
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,600
pursue wisdom humility and Detachment

weary long is samsara to fools who know

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,480
not the sublime truth

305
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:36,000
if as the disciple fares along he meets

306
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,160
no companion who is better or equal let

307
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,920
him firmly pursue his solitary career

wealth a fool who knows his foolishness

314
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,120
is wise at least to that extent but a

315
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:07,279
fool who thinks himself wise is a fool

316
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,480
indeed though all his life a fool

317
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,440
Associates with a wise man he no more

318
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,639
comprehends the truth than a spoon

319
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,639
tastes the flavor of the

320
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,639

unto themselves as they move about doing

327
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,639
evil Deeds

328
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,920
the fruits of which are

329
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,959
bitter ill done is that action of doing

330
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,480
which one repents later and the fruit of

331
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:41,920
which one weeping reaps with

332
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,839
tears well done is that action of doing

333
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,360
which one repents not later and the

334
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,720
fruit of which one reaps with delight

335
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,040
and

336
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,279
happiness so long as an evil deed has

337
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,320
not ripened the fool thinks it as sweet

338
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,880
as honey but when the evil deed ripens

339
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,320
the fool comes to

340
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,720
grief month after month a fool may eat

341
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,279
his food with the tip tip of a blade of

342
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,880
grass but he still is not worth a 16th

343
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:05,040
part of the those who have comprehended

344
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,639
the

345
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:12,160
truth truly an evil deed committed does

346
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:15,240
not immediately bear fruit like milk

347
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,360
that does not turn sour all at once but

348
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,279
smoldering it follows the fool like fire

349
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,800
covered by

350
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,920
Ashes to his own ruin the fool gains

351
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,440
knowledge for it Cleaves his head and

352
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,880
destroys his innate

353
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,279
goodness the fool seeks undeserved

354
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,839
reputation precedence among monks

355
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:37,079
authority over monasteries and honor

356
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:40,759
among

357
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:43,399
householders let both laymen and monks

358
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:47,440
think that it was done by me in every

359
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:50,160
work great and small let them follow me

360
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,480
such is the ambition of the fool thus

361
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,800
his desire and pride

362
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,720
increase one is the Quest for worldly

363
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,839
gain and quite another is the path to

364
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,120
nibana clearly understanding this let

365
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,519
not the monk the disciple of the Buddha

366
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,519
be carried away by worldly Acclaim but

367
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,519
