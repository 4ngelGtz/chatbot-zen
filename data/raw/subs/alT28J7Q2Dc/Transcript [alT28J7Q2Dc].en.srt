1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,900
Master Kyogen has been meditating for 30 years

2
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,000
30 years of sitting in silence

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,500
30 years of wrestling with impossible riddles

4
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:21,833
30 years of feeling like everyone else got the joke

5
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:22,966
except him

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,000
he's done finished

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
burned out

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,233
today

9
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,700
he's sweeping temple grounds in the weight of failure

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,966
heavy in his hands

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,466
dust and broken tiles scatter across cold stone

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,666
one piece skitters forward strikes hollow bamboo

13
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,900
the sound cuts through 30 years of seeking

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,966
like a blade everything stops

15
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:47,200
his breath his thoughts

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,866
the entire universe of Kyogen the seeker

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,866
he drops his broom tear streaming

18
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:56,266
and writes

19
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,900
this isn't legend it's fact

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,366
"Transmission of the Lamp,"

21
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:12,266
the "Blue Cliff Record" all record this exact moment

22
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,566
but what Kyogen experienced

23
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:17,966
it breaks every framework we use to understand reality

24
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:18,466
what

25
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:21,033
if everything you think you know about enlightenment

26
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:23,733
is what's preventing you from recognizing it

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,833
welcome to Satori the awakening that makes no sense

28
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,700
until it's the only thing that does

29
00:01:33,566 --> 00:01:36,300
so what actually happened in that temple courtyard

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
according to Kyogen's own account

31
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,933
preserved in classical Zen literature

32
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:43,000
nothing mystical occurred

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,100
no visions no cosmic downloads

34
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:48,166
no divine interventions

35
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:51,066
the tile broke made a sound

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,100
and suddenly

37
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,366
the question that had tortured him for decades

38
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:55,700
became meaningless

39
00:01:56,866 --> 00:02:00,166
the secret dissolves what remains was never absent

40
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,133
what makes this story unshakable

41
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:12,200
other authenticated masters verified it

42
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,600
Master Yangshan heard Kyogen's poem and declared

43
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:18,700
he has truly seen his original nature

44
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,600
his former teacher Master Isan

45
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:26,700
reportedly wept these weren't sentimental reactions

46
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,633
in Zen tradition

47
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:29,933
only someone who's moved beyond seeking

48
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,266
can recognize when seeking genuinely stops

49
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:37,366
but Kyogen's case reveals Satori's core impossibility

50
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:40,833
how do you teach someone to stop seeking

51
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,966
without giving them a new thing to seek

52
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:46,800
the Sixth Patriarch Hui Neng

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,300
faced this exact problem

54
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,866
when students begged for awakening techniques

55
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:53,966
his response was recorded in the Platform Sutra

56
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:05,500
Master Huang Po was direct

57
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:12,400
in other words

58
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,466
what you're looking for is what's looking

59
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:19,000
this paradox appears in every authentic Satori account

60
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,966
Dogen founder of Soto Zen

61
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:23,466
described his breakthrough

62
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,900
notice what he didn't say

63
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,566
he didn't gain special knowledge

64
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:41,300
he didn't achieve a higher state

65
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,566
he recognized what was present

66
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:45,766
when the mental activity of seeking

67
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,200
temporarily stopped

68
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:54,066
Shunryu Suzuki who brought Zen to America put it simply

69
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,266
modern teacher Brad Warner had the same recognition

70
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:07,866
it wasn't that I understood some cosmic truth

71
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:10,733
it was realizing I'd been asking the wrong question

72
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,300
the wrong question being how do I get enlightened

73
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:16,000
the recognition

74
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,600
there's no separate I to get enlightened

75
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,766
Alan Watts who brought Zen to the west

76
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:26,933
captured this paradox perfectly

77
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,666
and when you come to the point

78
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:32,100
that nothing you can do is right

79
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,933
suddenly there is a flip in consciousness

80
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:38,233
which is called in Zen satori

81
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:39,033
s a t o

82
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:41,566
r I or sudden awakening

83
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:44,066
and at that moment

84
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,600
the observing self

85
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,033
the self which comments on oneself all the time

86
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:51,466
the self which obstructs

87
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:54,133
dissolves and disappears

88
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,900
the more you try to catch hold of this moment

89
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,566
the more it slips away Satori

90
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:03,466
is the sudden realization

91
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,200
that you were never separate

92
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,533
from what you were seeking

93
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,500
but here's what nobody warns you about

94
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,433
this recognition can shatter unprepared minds

95
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:13,433
the ego structure

96
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:16,066
that suddenly sees through its own transparency

97
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:19,100
doesn't always handle the discovery gracefully

98
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,933
but what happens when you put Satori under a microscope

99
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,866
Doctor Judson Brewer

100
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:31,333
stares at brain scans that shouldn't exist

101
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,300
for years

102
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,900
he's been studying advanced meditators at Yale

103
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,866
watching what happens inside their minds during deep

104
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:39,333
contemplative states

105
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,066
what he discovered

106
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:43,466
broke everything he believed about consciousness

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,433
the default mode network

108
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:48,566
the brain region responsible for the sense of me

109
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,533
completely shuts down

110
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:52,033
this network

111
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:55,033
normally burns 20% of the brain's total energy

112
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:57,933
it's what's active when you're planning worrying

113
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,400
remembering

114
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:02,266
essentially when you're lost in the story of yourself

115
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,633
during profound meditative states

116
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,300
this network goes dark

117
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:11,466
it's as if the sense of self temporarily disappears

118
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:15,533
Brewer explains the meditator reports pure awareness

119
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,166
without anyone aware

120
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,966
but here's what shocked him about Zen

121
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:22,066
practitioners reporting Satori

122
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:23,666
the default mode shutdown

123
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,033
doesn't happen gradually

124
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:28,333
in people describing sudden awakening experiences

125
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:31,700
it appears to occur instantaneously

126
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,600
one moment normal self referential brain activity

127
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,166
the next

128
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,700
complete neural silence

129
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,766
at Brown University

130
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:44,866
Doctor Willoughby Britton documented similar findings

131
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:48,533
her research on sudden gains in meditation

132
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:52,000
reveals that some practitioners report dramatic

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,200
permanent shifts occurring in discrete moments

134
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,700
rather than slow development

135
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,166
these aren't temporary altered states

136
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,633
Britton notes they describe

137
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:03,766
a fundamental change in how they perceive

138
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:05,766
the nature of consciousness itself

139
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:09,033
but here's where the machines hit a wall

140
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:09,800
brain scans

141
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,600
can show neural signatures of selfless awareness

142
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,200
they can demonstrate that the sense of separate self

143
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,933
has biological markers

144
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,800
they can prove these markers can be suspended

145
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,300
but they cannot measure recognition itself

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,633
think about it how do you scan

147
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:27,066
the moment

148
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:29,400
someone realizes they were looking for something

149
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,166
they already are you can scan before

150
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,266
you can scan after but recognition

151
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:36,900
it happens in the gap no machine can reach

152
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,533
the machines hum the screens glow

153
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,033
but when awareness recognizes itself

154
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:44,266
there's nothing left for them to record

155
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,900
this isn't a failure of technology

156
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,300
it's the nature of what we're investigating

157
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,633
the tile didn't cause awakening

158
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:53,766
it shattered the mind seeking it

159
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,666
here's the dirty secret

160
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,766
even enlightened masters won't admit

161
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,966
two monks stand before the fifth patriarch of Zen

162
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,800
both claim to understand the nature of mind

163
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,300
both have dedicated their lives to practice

164
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,566
both speak eloquently about awakening

165
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:17,533
but only one actually gets it

166
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,966
Master Shenxiu the senior disciple

167
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:25,066
presents his realization the body is the Bodhi tree

168
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,466
the mind is like a clear mirror stand

169
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:30,366
at all times we must strive to polish it

170
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:32,966
and must not let the dust collect

171
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:35,466
the community is impressed

172
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:38,733
sophisticated wisdom deep understanding of the path

173
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:42,266
then Huineng an illiterate rice pounder responds

174
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Bodhi originally has no tree

175
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,566
the mirror also has no stand

176
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,166
Buddha nature is always clean and pure

177
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,966
where is there room for dust

178
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:52,800
game over

179
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,900
Shenxiu's understanding was still operating

180
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,600
within the framework of someone who needed to maintain

181
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,566
enlightenment Huineng

182
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:03,700
recognized that what they were pointing to

183
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,933
was never actually obscured

184
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,500
recognition isn't something to gain

185
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,333
it's the end of trying to gain

186
00:09:12,366 --> 00:09:14,700
this case recorded in the Platform Sutra

187
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,133
exposes the authentication nightmare

188
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:19,300
both monks had genuine insight

189
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,900
both demonstrated contemplative mastery

190
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,733
both could teach effectively

191
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,466
but their realizations were qualitatively different

192
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,600
one understood how to polish awareness

193
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,200
the other saw that awareness was never tarnished

194
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:33,766
traditional Zen

195
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:35,566
developed brutal testing methods

196
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:37,133
to catch these distinctions

197
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:38,433
the "Gateless Gate,"

198
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:41,133
one of Zen's most important koan collections

199
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,600
was designed specifically to trigger satori

200
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:47,966
or expose false understanding

201
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:49,300
Master

202
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,066
Wumen who compiled these impossible puzzles warned

203
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:56,066
to realize the way you must pass through the barrier

204
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,900
set up by the patriarchs

205
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
to attain this subtle awakening

206
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,166
you must completely cut off the mind road

207
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,766
in other words thinking your way to enlightenment

208
00:10:07,766 --> 00:10:09,733
is exactly what prevents it

209
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:11,866
Master Yunmen once struck a student

210
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:14,800
who gave a perfect textbook answer to a koan

211
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:17,266
your understanding is correct

212
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:20,700
he said but you're still trapped in concepts

213
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:24,200
Master Linji was famous for shouting at students

214
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,533
who spoke philosophically about emptiness

215
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:29,300
show me emptiness he'd demand

216
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:32,866
don't tell me about it but even these methods failed

217
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:33,766
regularly

218
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Philip Kapleau founder of Rochester Zen Center

219
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,866
received transmission from his Japanese teacher

220
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,000
years later he realized

221
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:46,166
I had mistaken a profound shift in perspective

222
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,300
for complete awakening Robert Aitken

223
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:51,166
another prominent American teacher

224
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,133
described similar discoveries

225
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,300
what I thought was enlightenment at 30

226
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,666
looked quite different from 60

227
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:02,533
the authentication problem cuts deeper

228
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,700
entire Zen schools

229
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,733
disagree about what constitutes genuine Satori

230
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,666
Rinzai emphasizes dramatic breakthrough experiences

231
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,866
Soto maintains that sitting meditation itself

232
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,500
expresses awakening

233
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,866
some traditions require specific recognitions

234
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:22,500
others dismiss all experiences as irrelevant

235
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,633
each school claims authentic transmission

236
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:28,300
each has produced undeniably wise teachers

237
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,266
yet their criteria are completely different

238
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,666
here's the ultimate verification paradox

239
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,166
the moment you create objective measures for Satori

240
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,100
you've turned recognition into achievement

241
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,966
the moment you systematize awakening

242
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,266
you've recreated the seeking framework

243
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:51,133
that Satori dissolves as Zen tradition puts it

244
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,533
only a Buddha recognizes a Buddha

245
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:56,800
but who authenticates the authenticator

246
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,900
but when authentication fails people die

247
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,566
Andrew Cohen students sat in silence as he screamed

248
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:10,800
at a woman for showing grief over her father's death

249
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:12,166
when she flinched

250
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:14,966
he made her stand in front of the group for hours

251
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:18,000
as punishment for spiritual weakness

252
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:21,133
to them this was compassion training

253
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,133
to outsiders it looked like psychological abuse

254
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:27,566
for decades Cohen taught as an enlightened master

255
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:30,000
he'd had powerful awakening experiences

256
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:33,266
he spoke brilliantly about nondual awareness

257
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,866
thousands considered him authentic

258
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,900
until his entire organization collapsed

259
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,066
amid allegations of manipulation

260
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:45,266
financial exploitation and cult like control

261
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,466
Cohen later admitted

262
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,933
I confused awakening with being awakened

263
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,366
this distinction matters more than life and death

264
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:56,466
having Satori experiences doesn't create a permanently

265
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:57,800
enlightened person

266
00:12:57,966 --> 00:13:00,766
it reveals what consciousness actually is

267
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:03,200
when seeking temporarily stops

268
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:06,833
but the mind's tendency to turn recognition

269
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,400
into spiritual identity

270
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,766
can poison the very clarity that was recognized

271
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:15,666
Master Hakuin documented this trap in brutal detail

272
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,466
after his first major satori

273
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:20,166
he felt invincible I thought

274
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,833
no one in the past 300 years

275
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,000
could have accomplished such a breakthrough

276
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:26,000
he'd walk through town thinking

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,266
these people don't realize

278
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,900
they're looking at a living Buddha

279
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,100
when his teacher dismissed his realization

280
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,400
Hakuin crashed into what he called Zen sickness

281
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:39,500
his hands shook sleep vanished

282
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,400
the man who thought he'd conquered suffering

283
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:44,200
couldn't get out of bed

284
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,866
but this collapse revealed deeper truth

285
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:50,633
Hakuin realized his Satori had been genuine

286
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:53,966
but his interpretation was contaminated by ego

287
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,733
the recognition itself was authentic

288
00:13:56,966 --> 00:14:00,666
the story about being enlightened was delusion

289
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,100
modern psychology now recognizes this pattern

290
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,900
Doctor Britton's research documents

291
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,000
spiritual emergence syndrome

292
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:13,400
the psychological crisis that often follows profound

293
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,133
contemplative experiences

294
00:14:15,766 --> 00:14:17,566
the psyche struggles to integrate

295
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:20,733
recognition that transcends normal categories

296
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:25,133
without proper support people develop grandiosity

297
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:29,933
paranoia or complete dissociation from reality

298
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,500
the spiritual marketplace makes this worse

299
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,533
social media rewards dramatic enlightenment claims

300
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,600
teachers build careers on awakening stories

301
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,500
students seek experiences rather than understanding

302
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,966
this creates what researcher John Wellwood called

303
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:50,366
spiritual bypassing using

304
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:53,733
spiritual concepts to avoid psychological maturity

305
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:57,666
so how do you recognize authentic Satori

306
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,866
versus sophisticated delusion

307
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:04,900
genuine awakening according to every verified account

308
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,666
makes people more ordinary

309
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,333
not more special

310
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:10,933
they don't claim enlightenment

311
00:15:11,366 --> 00:15:14,000
they don't need recognition as awakened

312
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,266
they function in normal life

313
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:18,866
without maintaining any particular state

314
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,566
as the saying goes:  before enlightenment

315
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:24,066
chop wood carry water

316
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:28,166
after enlightenment chop wood carry water

317
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,500
the difference after Satori

318
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,366
there's no one who thinks they're enlightened

319
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,833
authentic Satori doesn't make you a Buddha

320
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,366
it makes you human again and yet

321
00:15:39,366 --> 00:15:41,466
that's precisely why it's so dangerous

322
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:44,400
because even the mind that glimpses its own absence

323
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,900
can turn that into a story about being special

324
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:50,733
the final twist will blow your mind

325
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,100
after examining historical records

326
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,100
brain research

327
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,333
authentication failures and psychological dangers

328
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:05,133
what can we actually say about Satori

329
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,700
here's what we know the phenomenon is real

330
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,433
the descriptions span centuries

331
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:12,366
with remarkable consistency

332
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:15,166
the neurological effects are measurable

333
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,800
the psychological changes are lasting

334
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:20,500
but here's what remains unknowable

335
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,766
whether any individual's claim represents

336
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:24,133
authentic Satori

337
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,666
whether our descriptions capture what actually happens

338
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,033
whether we're even studying the same recognition

339
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,766
the masters pointed to

340
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:36,900
and this limitation isn't a bug in our research

341
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,133
it's a feature of what we're investigating

342
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,000
because Satori according to every account

343
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,566
dissolves the framework we use to evaluate experiences

344
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,366
Alan Watts put it simply awakening is not a thing

345
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:51,733
it is not a goal not a concept

346
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:53,900
it is not something to be attained

347
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,666
it is a metamorphosis

348
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,566
there's no one left to get enlightened

349
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,866
and yet here we are watching wondering searching

350
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,900
the ultimate evidence based conclusion

351
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,833
Satori cannot be proven

352
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,366
because it dissolves the framework of proof

353
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,366
cannot be achieved

354
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:18,500
because it reveals what was never absent

355
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:20,500
cannot be understood

356
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,400
because it transcends the understander

357
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:26,400
yet it remains the most thoroughly documented

358
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,900
impossible experience in human history

359
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,433
every shred of proof points to recognition

360
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:34,200
that exists beyond evidence

361
00:17:34,766 --> 00:17:37,100
every verification method validates

362
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,200
something that cannot be verified

363
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,266
every explanation explains why

364
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:44,566
explanation misses the point

365
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,233
but maybe this failure is the most important discovery

366
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,433
because it suggests that what Zen masters

367
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:52,800
have pointed to for 15 centuries

368
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,966
exists in the gap between what we can know

369
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,500
and what we can be

370
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:01,900
the tile didn't cause Kyogen's awakening

371
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,566
it revealed what was present

372
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:05,533
when the mental activity of seeking

373
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,466
temporarily stopped

374
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:10,800
that revelation cannot be captured by any method

375
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,066
that assumes a separate investigator

376
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,533
studying an external mystery

377
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,666
the more you grasp at it the further it slips away

378
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,900
maybe that's the only clue we'll ever get

379
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:26,033
because Satori isn't a mystery to be solved

380
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:27,266
it's the recognition

381
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:30,933
that the one trying to solve mysteries was itself

382
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,066
the mystery

383
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,866
and that recognition happens when

384
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:36,066
it happens usually

385
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:37,500
when you've completely given up

386
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,866
trying to make it happen

387
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,000
the investigation ends where it began

388
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,600
with more questions than answers

389
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,166
but maybe that's perfect

390
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:49,900
comment below tell us about the moment

391
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,800
your mind went completely quiet

392
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:54,133
maybe you were washing dishes

393
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,666
maybe someone died maybe you were stuck in traffic

394
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,166
what happened when seeking just stopped

395
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,833
subscribe to Buddha's wisdom

396
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,966
for more explorations into consciousness

397
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:10,300
and the experiences that change everything

398
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,500
hit the notification bell

399
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,766
some recognitions are worth investigating together

400
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:18,900
and remember if you think you figured out Satori

401
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,500
from watching this video

402
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:22,900
you've completely missed the point

403
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:24,433
and missing the point

404
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:27,166
might be the most enlightened thing you've done today
