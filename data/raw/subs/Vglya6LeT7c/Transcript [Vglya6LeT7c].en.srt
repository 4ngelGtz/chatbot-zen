1
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:09,000
have you ever met someone

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,375
and felt like you've known them your entire life

3
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,875
or visited a place for the first time

4
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:16,666
yet somehow knew your way around

5
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:17,500
oh

6
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:18,500
deja vu

7
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,500
what about that recurring dream

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,083
where you're someone else entirely

9
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,708
these aren't just weird coincidences

10
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,916
they're fragments of your past lives

11
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,791
leaking into your present consciousness

12
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,500
ancient Buddhist masters

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,916
discovered techniques to access these hidden memories

14
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,583
thousands of years ago and today

15
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,833
I'll show you how to unlock the secret stories

16
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:43,166
of who you were before you were you

17
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,833
hey wisdom seekers Matt here

18
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,958
what if I told you that your soul has lived dozens

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,291
hundreds or even thousands of lives before this one

20
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,583
in Buddha's teachings

21
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,791
your consciousness doesn't vanish after death

22
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,666
it continues its journey

23
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:03,916
during his enlightenment

24
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,791
Buddha gained the ability to see his previous lives

25
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,208
a spiritual insight

26
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,250
that revealed hundreds of past existences

27
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,500
as part of the Three Knowledges of awakening

28
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,458
just imagine what you might discover about yourself

29
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,500
if you could peek behind that veil

30
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,208
in our previous video on Samsara

31
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,166
we explored the cycle of rebirth

32
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,958
but today we're going deeper

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,583
we're going to explore the signs that you've lived

34
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:30,916
before scientific evidence that's shocking researchers

35
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:31,541
and actual

36
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:34,000
techniques to glimpse your previous existences

37
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:39,458
so stick around because the person you are today

38
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,750
is just the latest chapter in your soul's epic story

39
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,958
before we jump into how to access your past lives

40
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,875
let's talk about what's actually happening when you die

41
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:54,875
and get reborn

42
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,458
unlike what many people think

43
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,875
Buddhism doesn't teach that your exact personality

44
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,666
or soul jumps into a new body

45
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:06,333
it's more like your consciousness continues its journey

46
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,750
carrying the imprints of all your previous actions

47
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,875
think of it like this

48
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,916
if you light one candle from another

49
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,333
is it the same flame

50
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:18,000
not exactly but there's a direct connection

51
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,208
the Buddha called this dependent origination

52
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,458
nothing arising independently

53
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,041
everything connected to what came before

54
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,958
in the Dhammapada Buddha said

55
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,250
this isn't just about your current life

56
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,250
these patterns carry across lifetimes

57
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,666
now here's where it gets wild

58
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,208
ancient Buddhist writings

59
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,708
tell us about people who remembered specific details

60
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,041
from lives they lived hundreds of years ago

61
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,375
the most famous is the Buddha himself

62
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,833
who on the night of his enlightenment

63
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,500
gained the ability to see all his past lives

64
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,875
he described being animals

65
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,916
humans of different social classes

66
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,458
and even divine beings

67
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,000
and this isn't just ancient history

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,791
a psychiatrist named Doctor Ian Stevenson

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,666
documented over 3,000 cases of children

70
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,666
who remembered specific details from past lives

71
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,791
kids who could speak languages they never Learned

72
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,291
or accurately describe towns they'd never visited

73
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,583
some even had birthmarks

74
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,583
matching fatal wounds from their previous life's death

75
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,000
I know what you're thinking

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,583
this sounds crazy right

77
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,541
but let me ask you a question

78
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,500
have you ever had a

79
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,208
strange skill that came naturally to you for no reason

80
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,333
felt drawn to a specific culture or time period

81
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,791
you have no connection to

82
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,875
experienced intense deja vu

83
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,000
that felt like more than just a brain glitch

84
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,250
if you answered yes to any of these

85
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,041
you might be experiencing echoes from your past lives

86
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,000
and in the next chapter

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,500
we'll look at the evidence that's making

88
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,625
even scientists question everything

89
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,541
they thought they knew about consciousness

90
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,500
let's get into the evidence

91
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,708
and trust me some of this will blow your mind

92
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,125
take the case of James Leininger

93
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,875
a little boy from Louisiana

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,291
at age 2 he started having horrific nightmares

95
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,500
about a plane crash he'd scream

96
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,500
plane on fire little man can't get out

97
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,125
during the day

98
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,250
he knew details about World War 2 aircraft

99
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,750
that mystified his parents

100
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,583
when they showed him a map

101
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,708
he pointed to Iwo Jima and said

102
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,625
that's where my plane went down

103
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,250
his father skeptical at first

104
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,666
became a believer when James named his plane Corsair

105
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,458
his aircraft carrier Natoma Bay

106
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,166
and even identified his fellow pilot friends

107
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,958
from photographs all historically accurate

108
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,333
details no toddler could possibly know

109
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,916
James's nightmares were so vivid

110
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:55,750
that he would wake up

111
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,291
screaming and kicking at the ceiling of his bedroom

112
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,708
trying to escape his burning cockpit

113
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,166
after years of research

114
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,041
his stunned parents found evidence

115
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,916
he was the reincarnation of James Houston Jr

116
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:11,416
a pilot who died exactly as the boy described

117
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,875
or consider the case documented

118
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,916
in our Buddhist archives of a girl in Tibet who

119
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,083
at age 3

120
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:22,000
correctly identified possessions of a deceased nun

121
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,916
and knew secret details only the nun would have known

122
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,666
the monks tested her

123
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,500
by mixing the nun's prayer beads with similar ones

124
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:33,000
she immediately picked out the correct mala and said

125
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,500
these were mine in my previous life

126
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,041
Doctor Jim Tucker at the university of Virginia

127
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,208
has documented over 2,500 cases of children

128
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,541
with past life memories

129
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,000
most of these kids

130
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,583
start talking about their previous lives

131
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,500
between ages two and four

132
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,000
before they're exposed to these concepts

133
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:55,000
by age 7 these memories typically fade away

134
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,125
the young mind not yet fully formed

135
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,875
seems to maintain a connection to what came before

136
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,041
from a scientific standpoint

137
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,333
consciousness remains the greatest mystery

138
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,958
the hard problem of consciousness

139
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,208
how physical processes in the brain

140
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,000
create subjective experience

141
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,916
is still unsolved

142
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,875
some quantum physicists like Roger Penrose

143
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:17,500
even suggest

144
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,708
consciousness might exist at a quantum level

145
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,791
potentially surviving physical death

146
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,500
from a Buddhist perspective

147
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
consciousness doesn't come from the brain

148
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,708
the brain is more like a receiver

149
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,791
picking up consciousness like a radio picks up signals

150
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,000
in the Lankavatara Sutra

151
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,416
the Buddha compares consciousness to an ocean

152
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,875
with waves constantly rising and falling

153
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,458
your current life is just one wave

154
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,416
in this vast ocean of consciousness

155
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,916
now skeptics might say these are just coincidences

156
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,250
or false memories

157
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,250
but when a three year old can speak a dead language

158
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,916
she was never exposed to

159
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,208
or when someone under past life regression

160
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,416
reveals historical details they couldn't possibly know

161
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,416
it gets harder to dismiss

162
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,083
if you're feeling skeptical right now

163
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,541
that's completely natural

164
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,125
the Buddha himself encouraged questioning

165
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,750
rather than blind acceptance

166
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:10,541
he said

167
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,000
not to believe something just because it's tradition

168
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,166
or taught by a respected teacher

169
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,250
instead observe and test it yourself

170
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,041
throughout this video

171
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,875
I invite you to maintain that healthy skepticism

172
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,083
while still considering evidence that has puzzled

173
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,166
even the most rigorous researchers

174
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,166
even Carl Jung the famous psychologist

175
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:34,125
considered the possibility of ancestral memory

176
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,125
that we inherit not just physical traits

177
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,958
but psychological imprints from our ancestors

178
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,083
Buddhist masters would say that's partially right

179
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,916
but these memories come from our own past lives

180
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,625
not just our genetic lineage

181
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,458
interestingly modern near death experiences

182
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,833
NDE's share similarities

183
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,416
with Buddhist descriptions of the between life state

184
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,750
people who clinically died and were revived

185
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,416
often report a life review

186
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,000
that mirrors

187
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,333
the Buddhist understanding of how karma transfers

188
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,375
between lives

189
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,500
while NDE's aren't proof of rebirth

190
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,500
they suggest consciousness might continue

191
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,291
beyond

192
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,791
what we currently understand about physical death

193
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,375
aligning with ancient Buddhist insights

194
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:20,000
the most compelling evidence might be right inside you

195
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,291
those inexplicable fears talents

196
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,833
and attractions that have been with you since birth

197
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,416
where did they come from

198
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,583
in the next chapter

199
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,666
we'll look at the signs that you personally

200
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,041
might be carrying memories from previous lives

201
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,166
now let's talk about you

202
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,875
how can you tell if you're carrying

203
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,333
fragments of past lives

204
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,833
here are seven signs that Buddhist teachers

205
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,958
and modern researchers both recognize

206
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,583
first unexplained phobias

207
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,208
fear of water

208
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,916
despite never having a traumatic swimming experience

209
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,166
terror of heights with no obvious cause

210
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,375
in Buddhist understanding

211
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,416
these might be imprints from how you died

212
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,958
in a previous life

213
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,708
the Tibetan Book of the dead

214
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,416
describes how the moment of death creates powerful

215
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,750
karmic imprints that carry forward

216
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,833
someone who drowned

217
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:17,125
might be reborn with an instinctive fear of water

218
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,083
second

219
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,500
recurring dreams where you're someone else entirely

220
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,000
these aren't just random brain activity

221
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,708
in these dreams you might wear unfamiliar clothing

222
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,750
speak languages you've never Learned

223
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:32,583
or navigate places that feel strangely like home

224
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,208
Buddhist dream yoga practitioners

225
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,583
consider these among the most reliable windows

226
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,666
between lives

227
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,125
pay special attention to dreams that repeat

228
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,833
with unusual clarity or emotional intensity

229
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
dreams where you have different physical features

230
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,083
live in a different time period

231
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,833
or possess skills you don't have in waking life

232
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,625
are particularly significant

233
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,125
the mind in sleep sometimes slips between the barriers

234
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:59,166
separating your current identity from previous ones

235
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,416
third instant recognition

236
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,708
ever meet someone and feel an immediate connection

237
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,000
or aversion that makes no logical sense

238
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,500
in our video on Karma

239
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
we discussed how souls travel together

240
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,083
through multiple lifetimes

241
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,583
the Sanskrit term pratitya-samutpada

242
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,750
or dependent origination explains how nothing

243
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,541
including relationships

244
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:29,125
arises without causes from previous existences

245
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,666
I experienced this myself

246
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,166
with a meditation teacher I met in Thailand

247
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,208
the moment we were introduced

248
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,166
we both stopped and stared at each other

249
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,666
with instant recognition

250
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:41,333
he later told me

251
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,000
he felt we'd studied together in a previous life

252
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,500
and strangely

253
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,500
I found myself instinctively trusting his guidance

254
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,166
in a way I couldn't explain

255
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,458
many of you have probably experienced something similar

256
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,958
that person you felt you'd known forever

257
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,583
within minutes of meeting them

258
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,583
fourth unlearned knowledge or skills

259
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,166
children who can play complex musical pieces

260
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,916
without training people who can understand languages

261
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,041
they've never studied

262
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,416
the Buddha described talents as seeds

263
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,000
planted in previous lives

264
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,875
that bloom when conditions are right

265
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,208
fifth deja vu experiences that feel intensely real

266
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,250
Buddhist texts describe this as

267
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,000
memory leakage between lives

268
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,833
when you experience something

269
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,500
similar to a powerful moment from a past life

270
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,833
the barriers between lives temporarily thin

271
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,833
sixth birthmarks

272
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,583
or physical traits that correspond to past life wounds

273
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,750
Doctor Ian Stevenson though his work remains debated

274
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,458
documented cases where children had birthmarks

275
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,500
corresponding to reported wounds from claimed

276
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,000
previous lives

277
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,750
while fascinating this research invites both interest

278
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,291
and healthy skepticism the Buddhist concept of gandhabba

279
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,500
or the connecting consciousness between lives

280
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,125
suggests how strong physical trauma might potentially

281
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,333
imprint on the new body

282
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,000
seventh inexplicable attraction to certain cultures

283
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,708
time periods or places

284
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,625
feel mysteriously drawn to ancient Egypt

285
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,041
without knowing why or perhaps

286
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,875
Japanese culture feels more like home than your own

287
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,791
Buddhist teachers say

288
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,625
these are places where you've spent significant

289
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,000
past lives and if you're that person who's a

290
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,833
little too obsessed with ancient Egypt

291
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,000
or medieval Japan

292
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,208
despite having no connection to those places

293
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,166
I hate to break it to you

294
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,375
you're probably experiencing past life bleed through

295
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:32,833
sorry

296
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,541
it's not just a quirky personality trait after all

297
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,416
though I suppose it's better than discovering you were

298
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,875
I don't know a tax collector in a previous life

299
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,625
some past lives are definitely cooler than others

300
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,666
take a moment right now to reflect

301
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,041
think about that city you've always wanted to visit

302
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:55,208
without knowing why or that skill that came naturally

303
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,708
the first time you tried it

304
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,875
these personal mysteries might be breadcrumbs

305
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,375
leading back to who you once were

306
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,666
so how many of these signs do you have

307
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,375
one or two might be coincidence

308
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,875
but if several resonate with you

309
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,583
there's a good chance you're sensing echoes

310
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:14,333
from your past lives but sensing them isn't enough

311
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,041
what if you could actually access these memories

312
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:17,875
directly

313
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,916
in the next chapter

314
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,916
I'll share techniques that Buddhist practitioners

315
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:22,958
have used for centuries

316
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,791
to pierce the veil between lives

317
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,416
now for what you've been waiting for

318
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,541
how can you actually access these past life memories

319
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,166
let's explore both ancient Buddhist methods

320
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,791
and modern adaptations that anyone can try

321
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,750
Buddha shared a meditation approach called

322
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,583
pubbenivāsānussati-ñāna

323
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,125
the knowledge of remembering past lives

324
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,375
on the night of his enlightenment

325
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,250
he used this to see all his previous existences

326
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,500
while full mastery might take years of meditation

327
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,666
practice we can still adapt some elements

328
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:57,541
for beginners

329
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,958
here's a simplified version you can try at home

330
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,583
find a quiet space where you won't be disturbed

331
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,000
sit comfortably with your spine straight

332
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,750
take three deep breaths to center yourself

333
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:09,791
now

334
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,500
focus on your natural breathing for about five minutes

335
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,958
until your mind becomes calm

336
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,583
like still water once settled

337
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,083
bring to mind something from your life

338
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,125
that feels significant but unexplained

339
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:23,833
maybe a recurring dream an inexplicable fear

340
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,166
or a place you feel drawn to

341
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,541
holding this gently in your awareness

342
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,375
ask yourself

343
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:33,208
when have I experienced this before

344
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:37,375
don't force any answers just remain open and receptive

345
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,875
as you try this yourself

346
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,625
don't push for dramatic visions

347
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:44,000
often past life memories begin as subtle feelings

348
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,416
or impressions a familiar scent

349
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,083
an emotion tied to a specific setting

350
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,125
or a fleeting image

351
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,166
that feels strangely significant to you

352
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,500
as thoughts or images arise

353
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,166
observe them without judgment

354
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,000
you might see flashes of unfamiliar places

355
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,041
feel emotions connected to events you don't recognize

356
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,000
or hear snippets of conversation

357
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,583
these could be fragments of past life memories

358
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,000
beginning to surface

359
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,416
another powerful technique comes from Tibetan Buddhism

360
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,625
it involves focusing on the moment between sleep

361
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:17,958
and wakefulness

362
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,041
as we explained in our recent video

363
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,833
on the Tibetan Book of the dead

364
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,333
these transitional states are called bardos

365
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,958
just like the Bardo between death and rebirth

366
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,375
offer glimpses beyond ordinary reality

367
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,791
the Bardo between wakefulness and sleep

368
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,458
creates a similar gateway

369
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,916
Tibetan dream yogis believe this twilight state thins

370
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,833
the veil between your current life and previous ones

371
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,083
when you're neither fully awake nor completely asleep

372
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,083
your consciousness

373
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:50,083
can more easily access the stream of past lives

374
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,041
as you're falling asleep

375
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,750
maintain a thin thread of awareness

376
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,708
while silently asking to be shown your past lives

377
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,125
keep a journal by your bed to record any insights

378
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,208
when you wake up

379
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,958
this practice works because

380
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,000
as we covered in our Bardos video

381
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,458
consciousness exists in a continuum

382
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,375
the same awareness that travels through the death

383
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,291
Bardo can be accessed in these mini bardos

384
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,750
we experience daily

385
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,500
if you've tried the meditation techniques

386
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,541
from that video

387
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,000
you already have a foundation for this practice

388
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,000
for those who want a more guided experience

389
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,125
past life regression

390
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,500
with a trained professional can be effective

391
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,750
though not originally a Buddhist practice

392
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,375
and somewhat controversial in scientific circles

393
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,958
regression can sometimes yield insights

394
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,333
that align with Buddhist understandings of rebirth

395
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,250
it's best approached with an open but discerning mind

396
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,333
through gentle hypnosis

397
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,458
you're guided back through your current life and beyond

398
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,291
to previous existences

399
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,708
important warning though

400
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,708
sometimes there are blocks between lives

401
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:54,666
for good reason

402
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,625
the Buddha taught that some memories remain hidden

403
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,500
because they might overwhelm us

404
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,708
or disrupt our current life's purpose

405
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,250
if you encounter resistance

406
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,208
or distress during these practices

407
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,000
respect those boundaries

408
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,458
not all past life knowledge

409
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,333
is helpful for your present journey

410
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,708
if you do access something disturbing

411
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,458
Buddhist tradition offers guidance

412
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,875
the purpose of knowing past lives isn't

413
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:20,833
to dwell in them

414
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,166
but to free yourself from unconscious patterns

415
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:27,166
apply the wisdom of impermanence anicca

416
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,166
remember that whatever happened is not happening now

417
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,416
you are not bound to repeat those experiences

418
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,208
some of you might be thinking

419
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,125
this sounds like imagination

420
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,416
not memory the Buddha addressed this concern

421
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:43,458
he taught that

422
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,083
the line between imagination and spiritual insight

423
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,583
is thin trust your experience

424
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,375
but maintain right mindfulness

425
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,583
the ability to observe

426
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,333
without attachment to what arises

427
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,916
the goal isn't just to satisfy curiosity

428
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,875
it's to gain insights that liberate you in this life

429
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,041
and that's exactly what we'll explore next

430
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,916
how understanding your past lives

431
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,125
can transform your present existence

432
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,333
discovering your past lives

433
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,541
isn't just about cool stories to tell at parties

434
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,125
it's about transformation

435
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,541
let me share how this knowledge can radically

436
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,125
change your current life

437
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,791
first those stubborn patterns that keep showing up

438
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,416
the relationships that always end the same way

439
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,625
the financial struggles that never seem to resolve

440
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,541
the health issues that persist

441
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,250
despite everything you try

442
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,250
Buddha's teachings suggest

443
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,500
these might be karmic patterns

444
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,541
repeating across multiple lifetimes

445
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,791
in the Samyutta Nikaya Buddha says

446
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:44,708
for a long time

447
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,708
have you experienced the death of a mother

448
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,250
the death of a father for a long time

449
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,333
have you shed tears

450
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,125
he's pointing to the endless cycles we get caught in

451
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,125
but awareness breaks cycles

452
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,958
when you recognize a pattern as ancient

453
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,500
not just from your childhood

454
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,250
but from previous existences

455
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,375
you gain the power to finally change it

456
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,291
I've worked with people

457
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,000
who discovered their inexplicable fear of abandonment

458
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,250
stemmed from being left behind during wartime

459
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,666
several lifetimes ago

460
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,000
once they recognize the ancient source of their fear

461
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,750
their current relationship patterns

462
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,250
transformed completely

463
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,250
past life awareness

464
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,083
also explains those inexplicable soul connections

465
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,166
understanding these connections

466
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,750
can bring incredible peace

467
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,958
that difficult family member

468
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:32,625
might be someone

469
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,041
you've had many lives to work things out with

470
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,791
that instant soul connection with a stranger

471
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,541
might be recognition from countless

472
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:40,833
shared existences

473
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,000
then there's the mystery of your purpose

474
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,791
ever felt like you were born with a specific mission

475
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,958
but can't quite put your finger on it

476
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,750
Buddhist masters teach that we often

477
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,208
continue the spiritual work we began in previous lives

478
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,541
the Dalai Lama's process of recognizing

479
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,750
reincarnated lamas is based on this principle

480
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,166
children are identified by their natural inclinations

481
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,000
and abilities carried from past lives

482
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,500
your unusual interests or talents

483
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
point toward your soul's longer journey

484
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,166
that random passion for ancient languages

485
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,208
your ease with certain skills

486
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,708
that others find difficult

487
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,208
these could be

488
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,666
continued threads from previous existences

489
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,208
by exploring them you align with your deeper purpose

490
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,416
past life awareness also transforms how you view death

491
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,875
in the Anguttara Nikaya

492
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,000
Buddha teaches that understanding rebirth

493
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,875
releases us from fear of dying

494
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,375
when you recognize yourself

495
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,583
as part of a continuous stream of consciousness

496
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,125
rather than a one time event

497
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,125
the terror of ending disappears

498
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:48,000
you see this life as one chapter in a much longer story

499
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,875
but the ultimate power of past life awareness

500
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,625
is liberation from suffering

501
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,791
by seeing the patterns of attachment and aversion

502
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,666
played out over multiple lifetimes

503
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,333
you gain perspective

504
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,166
the things that seem so important now look different

505
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,291
when viewed through the lens of many lifetimes

506
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,291
this perspective naturally

507
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,750
leads to greater equanimity and compassion

508
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,166
as Buddha taught in the Dhammapada

509
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,458
through many births I have wandered

510
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,291
seeking but not finding the builder of this house

511
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,750
painful is birth again and again

512
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,833
when you recognize the cycles you've been caught in

513
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,416
you can finally begin to break free

514
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,416
but this leads us to some mind bending questions

515
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,833
if you've lived before and will live again

516
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,000
who exactly will you be next

517
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,666
and what does that mean for who you are right now

518
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,416
now let's explore the deepest questions

519
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:44,000
raised by past lives questions

520
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,333
that reach to the heart of Buddhist philosophy

521
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,041
if you've lived countless lives before

522
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,375
who will you become next according to Buddha

523
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,333
your actions now shape your future rebirth

524
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,166
the qualities you cultivate

525
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,000
and the compassion you develop

526
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,250
become the seeds of your next existence

527
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,541
but if rebirth continues

528
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,541
what's the purpose of Buddha's practice

529
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,208
this gets to the core teaching

530
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,666
the cycle of rebirth Samsara itself

531
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,583
is characterized by suffering

532
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,583
liberation means

533
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,458
freedom from the limitations of any single identity

534
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:19,625
or lifetime

535
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,916
as the Diamond Sutra teaches

536
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,250
all composed things are like a dream

537
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,625
a phantom a drop of dew

538
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,166
a flash of lightning

539
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:31,708
the separate self you consider you is temporary

540
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,916
while awareness itself is timeless

541
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:35,875
Buddhist teachings suggest

542
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,416
we've crossed paths with the same souls repeatedly

543
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,083
throughout countless lifetimes

544
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,916
your current parent might have been your child

545
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,916
your partner might have been your sibling

546
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:48,625
your adversary might have been someone you deeply loved

547
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,833
each relationship offers a chance to resolve karma

548
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,166
and grow in wisdom

549
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,916
the Tibetan concept of tendrel

550
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,541
or auspicious connection

551
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,708
suggests that meaningful relationships rarely happen

552
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:04,208
just once we're drawn back to the same souls

553
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,875
until we've Learned what we need from each other

554
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:12,000
next time you have a conflict with someone ask yourself

555
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:16,291
what might we be trying to resolve from our shared past

556
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,291
and how many times have you been here before

557
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,500
Buddhist cosmology suggests

558
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,583
the cycle of rebirth

559
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:25,541
has been going on for an inconceivable length of time

560
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,666
in the Samyutta Nikaya Buddha says

561
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,958
the tears you've shed through countless rebirths

562
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:33,291
would fill more than the four great oceans

563
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,916
that's a lot of past lives

564
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,083
some might be thinking

565
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,041
if I've had so many chances already and I'm still here

566
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:44,000
what hope do I have but the Buddha emphasized

567
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,666
that human rebirth is precious

568
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:46,500
precisely

569
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,208
because it offers the best opportunity for awakening

570
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:53,000
unlike animals or other realms

571
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,750
humans have both awareness of suffering

572
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,625
and the potential to transcend it

573
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:02,416
each human life is a rare opportunity

574
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:06,333
this brings us to perhaps the most profound question

575
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,750
can this be your last lifetime

576
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,125
according to Buddha yes

577
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,041
the entire path of Buddhist practice

578
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:16,666
aims at liberation from the cycle of rebirth

579
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,625
not because life is bad

580
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,791
but because awakening to your true nature

581
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:23,583
transcends the limitations of any single lifetime

582
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:26,458
in our video on Nirvana we explored

583
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:29,041
what it means to be free from the cycle of rebirth

584
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,458
it's not about escaping existence

585
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:33,708
but awakening to its true nature

586
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:34,958
when you realize

587
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:37,333
what in you is never born and never dies

588
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:40,250
the question of past and future lives transforms

589
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,875
as the Diamond Sutra says

590
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,958
all composed things are like a dream

591
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:47,083
a phantom a drop of dew

592
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:48,583
a flash of lightning

593
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:53,166
your separate self sense the you that seems so solid

594
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,708
is actually a temporary configuration

595
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,541
yet what witnesses all these lives is timeless

596
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,500
some Buddhist traditions

597
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,375
describe advanced practitioners

598
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,166
who choose to be reborn specifically to help others

599
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,625
these bodhisattvas

600
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:10,125
which we covered in our video on Maitreya

601
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:12,666
remember their past lives and purpose

602
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,333
while that level of mastery might take many lifetimes

603
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:19,250
each step toward greater awareness is meaningful

604
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,916
so here's your contemplation

605
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:23,666
what if you approached each day

606
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:26,166
as both the result of countless previous lives

607
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:28,208
and the cause of your future existence

608
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,208
how would you live differently

609
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,666
what patterns would you finally break

610
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:35,083
what qualities would you cultivate

611
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:37,208
the answers to these questions

612
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:39,583
don't just shape your philosophical understanding

613
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,000
they transform how you live right now

614
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,166
let's pull it all together

615
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:49,291
we've journeyed

616
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:51,625
through the Buddhist understanding of past lives

617
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:54,041
from the evidence that makes even skeptics wonder

618
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:55,833
to the signs you might be carrying

619
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,875
memories from previous existences

620
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,500
to techniques for accessing those memories yourself

621
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,166
and finally

622
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,875
to how this awareness can transform your life

623
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:08,166
the Buddha taught that understanding rebirth

624
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,458
isn't just philosophical speculation

625
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:13,333
it's practical wisdom for living more skillfully

626
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,708
right now when you recognize

627
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,791
that your consciousness has traveled through

628
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:20,041
many forms before this one

629
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:21,875
everything shifts

630
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:26,291
your priorities clarify your fears diminish

631
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:28,958
your compassion expands

632
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,000
remember the key takeaways

633
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:33,625
your unexplained fears

634
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:36,833
talents and attractions might be echoes from past lives

635
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,625
the techniques we've shared meditation

636
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,541
dream work and twilight awareness

637
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:43,625
can help you access these memories

638
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:47,625
understanding your karmic patterns from previous lives

639
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,708
gives you the power to finally change them

640
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,958
your current relationships likely continue

641
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:54,000
connections from many lifetimes

642
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,125
this human life

643
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:58,250
offers a rare opportunity for awakening

644
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,708
from the entire cycle

645
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:02,166
I want to leave you with a powerful quote

646
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,000
from the Buddha

647
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:06,250
just as the dawn is the forerunner of the rising sun

648
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,958
so true knowledge of the four noble truths

649
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:11,458
is the forerunner of the penetration of Nirvana

650
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,458
your growing awareness of your past lives

651
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,041
is part of this dawning knowledge

652
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,000
it's not the destination but a crucial step on the path

653
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,500
now I'm curious have you ever experienced

654
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,833
something that might be a past life memory

655
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:28,666
maybe a dream that felt too real to ignore

656
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:29,208
or

657
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:32,000
an inexplicable knowledge of a place you've never been

658
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:34,375
share your experiences in the comments

659
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:36,250
below your story

660
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,833
might help others recognize their own

661
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:39,166
past life connections

662
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,666
if you found this video helpful

663

665
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,083
with modern life

666
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,333
hit that notification bell

667
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,416
so you don't miss our upcoming video

668
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:56,541
on how meditation actually rewires your brain

669
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,458
this isn't the first time we've connected

670
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,041
and it won't be the last

671
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,625
the awareness you're developing in this lifetime

672
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:06,041
travels with you through the vastness of time

673
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:08,875
what if watching this video wasn't random chance

674
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:11,541
what if your soul has been searching for these answers

675
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:13,083
across many lifetimes

676
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:16,041
and today is the day you finally begin to remember

677
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:19,291
the next chapter of your journey starts now

678
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:23,875
see you in the next video or perhaps the next lifetime
