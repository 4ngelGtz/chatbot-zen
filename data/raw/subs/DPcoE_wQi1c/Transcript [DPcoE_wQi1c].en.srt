1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,833
a monk enters the library of an ancient temple

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,416
in one swift motion

3
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:15,833
he pours tea over a stack of precious Buddhist scrolls

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,333
the shocked students rush to save the texts

5
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,875
there says the monk

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,208
last time we saw how Zen shaped the samurai sword

7
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:31,916
before that

8
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,500
we explored Bodhidharma's incredible journey

9
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,583
the monk who brought Zen from India

10
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,916
and sparked the martial arts revolution

11
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,250
today we dive into the heart of what he taught

12
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,916
what exactly is this thing called Zen

13
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,375
that influenced warriors and monks alike

14
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,958
most Buddhist schools promise enlightenment

15
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,625
through careful study and practice

16
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:53,875
Zen?

17
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,125
Zen flips the table it says

18
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,458
you're already enlightened

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,958
you just don't know it yet

20
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,500
it's like looking everywhere for your glasses

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,458
while they're sitting on top of your head

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,708
this rebellious branch of Buddhism shaped everything

23
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,625
from Japan's deadly samurai

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,333
to its most delicate tea ceremonies

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,791
so what made Zen so different?

26
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,916
and why did emperors

27
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:22,416
warriors and artists all fall under its spell?

28
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,250
today we're stripping away the mystery

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,208
to reveal what Zen really is

30
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,666
no complicated philosophy

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,291
no foreign terms you can't pronounce

32
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,000
just the stark truth

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,416
about why a monk decided to stare at a wall

34
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:43,458
for nine years and how it changed Asia forever

35
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:52,041
A lone monk sits facing a wall in China's Shaolin Temple

36
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:55,000
9 years of silence this is Bodhidharma

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,250
and he's about to transform Buddhism

38
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,666
Buddhism had spread from India across the Silk

39
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:02,958
Road into China

40
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,541
monasteries filled their libraries with Sanskrit texts

41
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,500
translated into Chinese

42
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:13,041
the translation itself posed enormous challenges

43
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,083
Chinese scholars struggle to capture Indian concepts

44
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,000
with Chinese characters some invented new words

45
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,250
others borrowed Taoist terms

46
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,166
this mixing of Indian thought with Chinese culture

47
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,416
would prove crucial for what was to come

48
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:31,000
monks devoted lifetimes to studying sutras

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,666
debating philosophy and performing ceremonies

50
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,625
the path to enlightenment

51
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,750
had become increasingly complex

52
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,500
practitioners

53
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,250
followed elaborate systems of gradual progress

54
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,583
climbing spiritual ladder step by step

55
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,541
each stage

56
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,833
required mastering specific texts and practices

57
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,416
the path to enlightenment

58
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,833
seemed buried under mountains of words

59
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,833
enter Bodhidharma

60
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,541
tradition says he arrived by sea in southern China

61
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,541
around 520 C E

62
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,458
he looked at these studies

63
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,500
and declared them insufficient

64
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:09,500
his first famous encounter was with Emperor Wu of Liang

65
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,041
the emperor a devout Buddhist patron

66
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,291
proudly listed all his temple donations and good deeds

67
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,958
"what merit have I earned?" he asked

68
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:22,166
"none whatsoever" Bodhidharma replied

69
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,750
shocked the emperor asked

70
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,791
"what is the highest meaning of Buddhist truth?"

71
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,125
Bodhidharma answered "vast emptiness

72
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,708
nothing holy"

73
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,291
confused and offended the emperor asked

74
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,375
Bodhidharma said simply

75
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,125
this marked the birth of Chan Buddhism

76
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:50,333
the word Chan itself comes from the Sanskrit Dhyana

77
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,875
meditation no more relying solely on sacred texts

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,333
no more counting on rituals alone

79
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,166
instead

80
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,000
Bodhidharma taught direct experience through meditation

81
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,000
his students learn to look beyond words

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,083
and see reality directly his most famous student

83
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:08,916
Huike

84
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,000
allegedly stood in the snow and cut off his own arm

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,041
to prove his dedication to finding the truth

86
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,041
this revolutionary approach

87
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,875
transformed Chinese Buddhism

88
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,916
each master who followed developed their own methods

89
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,500
to shake students out of conceptual thinking

90
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,291
Master Mazu would shout so loudly

91
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,083
that students would be stunned into awakening

92
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,583
Linji struck his students

93
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,666
or answered questions with slaps

94
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:38,416
others posed impossible riddles called koans

95
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,833
what is the sound of one hand clapping?

96
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,208
what was your original face

97
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,333
before your parents were born?

98
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,166
all these methods

99
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,541
aim to break through intellectual understanding

100
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,375
and reach immediate realization

101
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,625
when these teachings reached Japan in the 12th century

102
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,500
they became known as Zen

103
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,125
Japanese monks like Eisai and Dogen

104
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,458
traveled to China to study Chan

105
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,500
then brought it back to Japan

106
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,166
Eisai established the Rinzai School

107
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:14,375
emphasizing koan study Dogen founded the Soto School

108
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,500
focusing on just sitting meditation

109
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,500
these remain the two major schools of Japanese Zen

110
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,208
today

111
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,166
yet both preserved Bodhidarma's essential teaching

112
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:28,125
direct pointing to the mind seeing your true nature

113
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,625
the stage was set for Zen

114
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,500
to influence every aspect of Japanese culture

115
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,458
from the way of the sword to the way of tea

116
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,458
but first we need to understand what

117
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:40,958
exactly

118
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,458
these masters discovered through their practice

119
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,375
traditional Buddhist

120
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:52,125
might spend years studying text about enlightenment

121
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,208
Zen masters took a different approach

122
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:57,666
consider Master Gutei who answered every question

123
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,750
by simply raising one finger

124
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:05,000
one day he heard his young attendant was imitating him

125
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,250
when asked a question about Zen

126
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,833
the boy would raise his finger

127
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,125
just like the master

128
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,583
so Gutei confronted his attendant

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,750
asked him about Zen and when the boy raised his finger

130
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,416
Gutei cut it off

131
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,291
as the boy ran away screaming

132
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,708
Gutei called after him when the boy turned around

133
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,958
Gutei raised his finger in that moment

134
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,791
the boy was enlightened shocking

135
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,750
that's exactly the point

136
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:39,416
Zen found traditional Buddhist methods too gentle

137
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,000
too gradual

138
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,833
it needed something immediate

139
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,416
direct even shocking

140
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,000
this led to Zen's three unique tools

141
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:54,541
Zazen Koans and Direct Transmission

142
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,791
Zazen sits at the heart of Zen practice

143
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,625
unlike other forms of meditation

144
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,041
Zazen doesn't try to achieve anything

145
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,125
you don't count breaths visualize Buddhas

146
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,083
or attempt to empty your mind

147
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,250
you simply sit facing a wall

148
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,708
watching reality unfold

149
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,333
Master Dogen spent years in China

150
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,916
searching for the true dharma

151
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,958
only to discover that just sitting itself

152
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,208
is enlightenment

153
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:26,541
he called this practice dropping off body and mind

154
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,708
the second tool koans

155
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:33,333
might be Zen's most famous innovation

156
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,791
what is your original face

157
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,583
before your parents were born

158
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,625
does a dog have Buddha nature

159
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,000
these questions aren't riddles to be solved

160
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,125
they're hammers

161
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,291
to break through the wall of conceptual thinking

162
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:50,541
a monk might spend years wrestling with a single koan

163
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,208
the answer can't come from logic or study

164
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,250
it must emerge from direct experience

165
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,833
take the koan about Dongshan and the river

166
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,916
one day crossing a stream

167
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,875
Dongshan saw his reflection and awakened

168
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:09,041
composing this verse "don't seek him elsewhere

169
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,958
far away he goes his own way

170
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,666
apart from me now I go my way alone

171
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,416
yet everywhere I meet him"

172
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,750
the third tool direct transmission

173
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,291
sets Zen apart from all other Buddhist schools

174
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,500
Zen insists that truth can't be captured in words

175
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,541
or concepts it passes from mind to mind

176
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,500
like a flame lighting another flame

177
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,541
this led to Zen's emphasis on the master

178
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,166
student relationship

179
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,000
each master develops

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,250
unique methods to spark awakening in their students

181
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,125
consider the story of Huineng

182
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:51,083
the Sixth Patriarch he was an illiterate woodcutter

183
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,791
who became one of Zen's greatest masters

184
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,666
when asked about Buddhist scriptures

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,750
he admitted he couldn't read

186
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,875
yet his direct understanding

187
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,791
surpassed all the scholarly monks

188
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,541
his story shows that Zen

189
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,000
truth exists beyond books and learning

190
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,416
but here's what makes Zen truly revolutionary

191
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:13,291
it points to ordinary mind as the way

192
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,750
your everyday consciousness eating

193
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,250
walking washing dishes

194
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,666
contains everything you need

195
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,541
Master Nansen told his students

196
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,500
"ordinary mind is the way"

197
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,083
the challenge isn't reaching some special state

198
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,291
it's seeing what's already here

199
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,916
without the filters of thought and judgment

200
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,583
this ordinary mind expresses itself in every action

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,166
a Zen master drinks tea with total attention

202
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,166
a Zen archer becomes one with the bow and target

203
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,000
even mundane tasks

204
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,083
like chopping wood and carrying water

205
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,875
become expressions of awakened mind

206
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,333
as one master put it "before enlightenment

207
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,166
chop wood carry water

208
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,458
after enlightenment chop wood

209
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,916
carry water"

210
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,500
the actions are the same

211
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,541
but the understanding is different

212
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,416
the samurai found an unexpected ally in Zen

213
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,166
here's a teaching that stripped away all excess

214
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,958
focused on the present moment

215
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,833
and faced death without flinching

216
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,958
perfect for a warrior's mind

217
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,458
remember the story from our last video

218
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,750
when Japan faced the Mongol invasion

219
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,916
Zen monks joined warriors on the front lines

220
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,000
but why

221
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,541
did these peaceful meditators

222
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,708
connect so deeply with warriors

223
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,708
the answer lies in Zen's

224
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,750
unique approach to mind and death

225
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,666
a samurai had to act without hesitation

226
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,291
think too much in battle you die

227
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,583
Zen taught exactly this

228
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,416
how to move beyond thinking into direct action

229
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,083
Master Takuan Sōhō explained it to master swordsman

230
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,750
Yagyū Munenori the mind must always flow like water

231
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,458
when blocked by thoughts it stagnates and you die

232
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,541
this state of no mind Mushin

233
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,166
became crucial for martial arts

234
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,708
a sword master doesn't think about their next move

235
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,041
they don't plan or strategize

236
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:23,458
they simply respond like a reflection in a mirror

237
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,750
this is pure Zen in action

238
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:30,000
no separation between mind and body

239
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,833
between thought and deed

240
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,500
death itself became a teacher

241
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,541
Zen monks meditated in graveyards

242
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,625
contemplating their own mortality

243
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,208
samurai did the same the famous saying

244
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,250
went "die before going into battle"

245
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,750
by facing death completely

246
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:56,458
fear disappears what remains is pure action

247
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,208
pure life

248
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:04,083
look at Miyamoto Musashi Japan's greatest swordsman

249
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,125
he wrote

250
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,916
this wasn't mere philosophy

251
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:12,875
he lived

252
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:16,666
it spending years in Zen temples between his duels

253
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,375
his final work The Book of Five Rings

254
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:23,041
reads like a Zen text simple

255
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,416
direct pointing to reality beyond words

256
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,000
the influence worked both ways

257
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,333
Zen temples adopted warrior discipline

258
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,291
the strict form we see in Zen today

259
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,875
the precise way of eating

260
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:40,875
walking sitting owes much to samurai culture

261
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,833
even the Zen meditation hall was organized

262
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,208
like a military camp

263
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,041
with strict hierarchies and precise timing

264
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,125
this marriage of Zen and the warrior spirit

265
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,666
created something unique

266
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,583
take kyudo Japanese archery

267
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,458
the goal isn't just hitting the target

268
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,458
it's about the perfect unity of archer

269
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,833
bow and target

270
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,083
one master archer was asked

271
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,333
"how do you never miss?" he replied

272
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:12,041
"I am one with the target when I release the arrow

273
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,500
I have already hit it"

274
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,708
the same principle appears in sword fighting

275
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,708
Master swordsmen

276
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,833
describe moments where the sword moves by itself

277
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,708
where there's no thought of self or other

278
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,666
attack or defense

279
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,500
this is what the samurai sought in Zen

280
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,083
not peace and tranquility

281
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,500
but the ability to act with absolute clarity

282
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,166
and conviction

283
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:38,708
even today

284
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,916
many martial arts dojos maintains Zen practices

285
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,000
students sit in meditation before training

286
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,250
they learn to move from their center

287
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,291
to act without hesitation

288
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,500
to face challenges directly

289
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,500
the warriors Zen continues to teach

290
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,500
that the truest peace comes not from avoiding conflict

291
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,125
but from moving through it with a clear mind

292
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,041
at first glance

293
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,458
a delicate tea ceremony seems worlds apart

294
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,083
from a samurai sword yet in Zen

295
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,750
they share the same spirit

296
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,375
both require total presence

297
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:19,250
perfect attention and movement without thought

298
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,583
take the tea ceremony

299
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,625
the host must execute hundreds of precise movements

300
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,541
yet make them seem natural as breathing

301
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,250
one wrong move breaks the spell

302
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,416
Master Sen no Rikyū taught that the ceremony's heart

303
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,000
wasn't about rules or rituals

304
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,208
it was about making a single bowl of tea

305
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,166
with complete attention nothing more

306
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,500
the same spirit appears in Zen painting

307
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,791
artists might spend years grinding ink

308
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,541
before making their first stroke

309
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,416
when they finally paint

310
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,541
it must happen in a single breath

311
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,708
no hesitation no corrections

312
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,500
look at Hakuin's circle paintings

313
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,208
one continuous stroke

314
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,458
captures the essence of enlightenment

315
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,708
perfect or imperfect doesn't matter

316
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,333
what matters is the pure expression of the moment

317
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,708
Zen garden strip away everything unnecessary

318
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,750
the famous rock garden at Ryōan-ji

319
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,750
contains only 15 rocks and raked gravel

320
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,458
yet it expresses something words can't touch

321
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,625
visitors sit for hours finding peace and its simplicity

322
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,791
the gardener maintains it each morning

323
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,500
like a moving meditation

324
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,583
each rake stroke as important as any sutra

325
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,333
even poetry became an expression of Zen Haiku

326
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,125
poets like Bashō

327
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,750
weren't trying to create beautiful verses

328
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,208
they were capturing direct experience

329
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,166
in the fewest possible words

330
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,083
"old pond frog jumps in splash"

331
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,500
no explanation needed

332
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,958
the experience speaks directly

333
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,791
these arts aren't decorative

334
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,166
their practice each one

335
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,958
offers a way to discover what Zen points to

336
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,916
the beauty and sufficiency of just this moment

337
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,458
exactly as it is

338
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,083
people often think Zen means sitting quietly

339
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,083
emptying your mind finding peace

340
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,916
but real Zen masters would laugh at this idea

341
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,500
remember the monk

342
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,166
who burned a wooden Buddha statue to keep warm

343
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,000
when others were shocked

344
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,166
he poked through the ashes saying

345
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,791
I'm looking for the sacred relics

346
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,833
that's Zen too

347
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,500
the first big mistake

348
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,500
Zen isn't about emptying your mind

349
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,833
Master Dogen was clear

350
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,250
thoughts aren't the enemy

351
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,208
they come and go like clouds in the sky

352
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,291
the point isn't to clear the sky of clouds

353
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:56,250
it's to stop mistaking clouds for the sky itself

354
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,250
one master put it this way

355
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,666
"those who try to empty their mind

356
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,791
are like someone trying to wash away blood with blood"

357
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,458
second misconception

358
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,750
Zen means being peaceful and passive

359
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,250
tell that to the master

360
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,500
who kicked over his students rice bowl

361
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,833
or Rinzai famous for shouting and striking his students

362
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,583
when a monk asked about Buddhist teaching

363
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,833
Rinzai shouted so loud the monk stumbled backward

364
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,458
that shout contained more

365
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:27,000
truth than 1,000 gentle sermons

366
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:31,083
Zen means being fully alive in each moment

367
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:35,416
sometimes that's peaceful sometimes it's fierce

368
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,625
third error Zen is mysterious and complicated

369
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,250
actually it's the opposite

370
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,458
Zen strips away the mysterious and complicated

371
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,125
when a monk asked Master Zhaozhou for teaching

372
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,041
he said have you eaten

373
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,666
then wash your bowl

374
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,333
that's it

375
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,500
when another asked about the deepest truth

376
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,791
Zhaozhou asked

377
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,708
why ask about the deepest truth when you

378
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,208
can't even see what's right in front of you

379
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,875
no mystery just this moment

380
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,000
fourth mistake

381
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,708
you need special conditions to practice Zen

382
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,875
a quiet temple special cushions

383
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,458
perfect piece

384
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,208
Master Foyan addressed this

385
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,791
"there is no special time or place for Zen 

386
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:21,583
practice

387
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,625
your daily life is the way"

388
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,583
a monk once complained to his master

389
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,208
about the noisy temple the master said

390
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,291
"you're trying to avoid the noise

391
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,791
let the noise avoid you"

392
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,666
the noisy office the busy street

393
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,875
these are your meditation hall

394
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,291
final misconception Zen is escapism

395
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,916
some think Zen means floating above life's problems

396
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,666
and spiritual bliss wrong again

397
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Zen means meeting life directly

398
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,166
fully engaging with every situation

399
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,625
as one master said "if you find Buddha

400
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,625
kill Buddha if you meet the patriarchs

401
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,083
kill the patriarchs"

402
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,750
don't escape into ideas of spirituality

403
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,250
wake up to what's right here right now

404
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,500
remember our tea spilling monk

405
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,125
now you understand

406
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,041
Zen isn't hidden in sacred text or perfect meditation

407
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,833
it's alive in each breath

408
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,750
each step each moment of your life

409
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,500
from Bodhidharma's wall gazing to the samurai sword

410
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,583
from the t masters careful movements

411
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,333
to the garden keepers rake

412
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,791
all these point to one truth

413
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,500
you're already complete

414
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,708
the only thing missing is your recognition of this fact

415
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,541
Master Linji put it perfectly

416
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:47,291
"the true person has no rank

417
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,291
no form

418
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,916
stop searching stop chasing

419
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,333
what you're looking for is what's looking"

420
00:19:58,875 --> 00:19:59,791

then remember

427
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,041
that cup of tea you're drinking

428
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,541
while watching this video

429
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,250
that's Zen too

430
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,333
if you know how to drink it
