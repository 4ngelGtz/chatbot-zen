highlights the importance of

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,760
self-respect Imagine a person who

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,400
consistently puts themselves down

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,360
apologizes for their existence and

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,640
allows others to mistreat them How

29
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,720
likely are others to respect someone who

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,280
doesn't respect themselves on the flip

31
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,880

themselves and sets healthy boundaries

34
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,280
they naturally command respect from

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:35,000
others so the first step to earning

36
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:37,759
respect is to cultivate a deep sense of

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,799

mindfulness In the Heat of the Moment

39
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,200
it's easy to react impulsively when

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,520
faced with

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,240

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,159

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,759
practice of being fully present and

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,719
aware of your thoughts and emotions by

45
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,920
developing mindfulness you create a

46
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:01,000
space between stimulus and response

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,000
allowing you to choose your actions

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,119
wisely imagine a scenario where a

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,840
coworker makes a snide remark about your

50
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,280

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,200
tension set clear

56
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,640
boundaries the Buddha taught the

57
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,360
importance of skillful communication and

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,599
setting clear

59
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,040
boundaries there's a story of a monk

60
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,519
named assaji who was known for his

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,280

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,760
a ritual that went against his

65
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,640
principles asay poit but firmly declined

66
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,120
explaining that it was not in line with

67
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,640
his

68
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:57,159
values the merchant initially offended

69
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,879
later reflected on asagi's integrity and

70
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:01,720
developed a deep respect for him this

71
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,319
story illustrates the power of

72
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,560
communicating your boundaries with

73
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:07,959

State of Mind amidst life's ups and

78
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,519
downs it's about responding to

79
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,360
disrespect with a sense of inner calm

80
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,120
and

81
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,640
stability imagine a Serene Lake on a

82
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,439
windy day while the surface May Ripple

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,080

103
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:22,360
change detach from

104
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,000
ego the Buddha taught the concept of

105
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,080
Anana or non-self which encourages us to

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,240
let go of our ego and the need for

107
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,000
external

108
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,759
validation when we're overly attached to

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,639
our ego we become more reactive to

110
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,880
disrespect and criticism imagine a

111
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,240
successful business woman who ties her

112
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,520
entire self-worth to her professional

113
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,120
achievements if a colleague questions

114
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,080
her abilities she might crumble under

115
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,320
the weight of her ego on the other hand

116
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,320
if she recognizes that her true Essence

117
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,360
goes beyond her achievements she can

118
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,000
respond to criticism with Grace and

119
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,440
resilience

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,600
practice

121
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,240
forgiveness Buddhism teaches that

122
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,520
holding on to resentment is like

123
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,120
grasping a hot coal with the intention

124
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,000
of throwing it at someone else you end

125
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,880
up burning yourself forgiveness on the

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,360
other hand is a path to Liberation it

127
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,039
doesn't mean condoning hurtful Behavior

128
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,880
rather it's about releasing the burden

129
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,160
of anger and

130
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,360
bitterness imagine a person who was

131
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,800
deeply hurt by a friend's

132
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,000
betrayal instead of plotting Revenge

133
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,400
they choose to forgive not for the

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,960
friend's sake but for their own Peace of

135
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Mind by practicing forgiveness you free

136
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,479
yourself from the toxic cycle of

137
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,680
disrespect and create space for healing

138
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,080
and

139
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,440
growth cultivate

140
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,039
wisdom the Buddha emphasized the

141
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,800
importance of developing wisdom and

142
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:57,759
insight to navigate life's challenges

143
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,479
when faced with disrespect seek to

144
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,440
understand the underlying causes often

145
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,280
people's hurtful actions stem from their

146
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,000
own unresolved pain and insecurities by

147
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,479
cultivating wisdom you can respond with

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,759
compassion and

149
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,400
skillfulness imagine a teenager who

150
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,440
lashes out at their parents with

151
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,039
disrespectful words instead of reacting

152
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,160
with anger a wise parent might recognize

153
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:24,440
the teen struggle for Independence and

154
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,400
approach the situation with

155
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,919
understanding and

156
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,840
patience speak your truth

157
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,919
the Buddha encouraged his followers to

158
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,280
speak their truth with authenticity and

159
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,680
integrity when you encountered

160
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,680
disrespect it's essential to stand up

161
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,199
for yourself and communicate your needs

162
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,680
and boundaries clearly there's a story

163
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,560
of a woman named Kissa gami who after

164
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,160
losing her child sought the Buddha's

165
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,680
help when others dismissed her grief the

166
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,400
Buddha listened to her with compassion

167
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,080
and helped her find

168
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,360
peace this story teaches us the power of

169
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,560
speaking Our Truth and seeking support

170
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,800

adversity Embrace

172
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,800
impermanence finally Buddhist teachings

173
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,759
remind us of the fleeting nature of all

174
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,960
experiences including

175
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,360
disrespect instead of getting caught up

176
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,560
in temporary

177
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,800
slights focus on your long-term growth

178
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,879
and the relationships that truly matter

179
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,560
imagine a monk who during his meditation

180
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,360
is bitten by a mosquito instead of

181
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,800
swatting it away in anger he simply

182
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,759
notes the sensation and returns to his

183
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,560
practice recognizing the impermanence of

184
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,240
the discomfort similarly when faced with

185
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,000
disrespect remember that it too shall

186
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,639
pass focus on your own growth and the

187
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,599
connections that nourish your
