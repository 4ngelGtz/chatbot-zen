existence in diving into our first

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,280
principle let's talk about impermanence

29
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:12,119
or Anika as it's known in P the ancient

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,920
language of many original Buddhist

31
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,560
texts Anika teaches us that all things

32
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,600
are in a constant state of flux

33
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,600
everything is changing moment to moment

34
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,040
this isn't just about the big changes we

35
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,920
all face like new jobs moving homes or

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,119
the natural process of Aging it's also

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,320
about the very subtle shifts the rise

38
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,439
and fall of your breath the changing

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,880
thoughts in your mind the EB and flow of

40
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:41,079
emotions why is this principle so

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,600
transformative because it challenges the

42
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:45,680
very root of human suffering our desire

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,560
to cling to what is familiar and our

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,159
fear of change we often grasp at

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,320
relationships material possessions or

46
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,840
even our own self-image trying to freeze

47
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,880
them in time but the truth of Ana tells

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,479
us this is like trying to hold on to

49
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,039
water it's not only feudal but leads to

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,479
inevitable suffering as we confront the

51
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,079
reality of change now you might be

52
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,239
wondering how can acknowledging

53
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,560
impermanence help me become unaffected

54
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,760
by life's

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,360
challenges the answer lies in The

56
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,800
Liberation that comes from letting go

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,959
when we truly understand and embrace

58
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,360
impermanence we start to release our

59
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:24,560
tight grip on expectations we learn to

60
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,440
appreciate the present moment knowing

61
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,800
it's all we truly have this doesn't mean

62
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,640
we become passive or indifferent in

63
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,599
instead we become adaptive resilient and

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,879
open to the flow of life to bring Ana

65
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,599
into your daily life start with a simple

66
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,800
mindfulness exercise take a few moments

67
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,239
each day to observe the impermanent

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,159
nature of things around you it could be

69
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,280
a straight forward as noticing how the

70
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,319
light changes in your room how your

71
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,360
thoughts come and go or how the

72
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:56,080
sensations in your body shift from one

73
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,920
moment to the next this practice can

74
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,000
gradually expand your acceptance of

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,760
change reducing fear and anxiety about

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,680
the

77
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,159
future remember embracing impermanence

78
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,239
doesn't mean we don't care about the

79
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,239
future or disregard the past it means we

80
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,760
find a profound peace in knowing that

81
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,840
change is the very nature of life

82
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,360
allowing us to face the unknown with

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,760
courage and

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,920
Grace by internalizing Ana we step into

85
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,920
a space where nothing can truly disrupt

86
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,760
our inner peace because we understand

87
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,920
that everything both joyous and

88
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,360
challenging is part of the ever-flowing

89
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,599
river of existence

90
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,439
moving on to our second Guiding Light we

91
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,519
delve into the principle of

92
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,720
non-attachment this principle is often

93
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,439
misunderstood as a call to disengage

94
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,640
from the world and its Pleasures but in

95
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:47,280
reality it's about finding freedom and

96
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,519
joy in life without being enslaved by

97
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,799
our desires and possessions

98
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,200
non-attachment teaches us to love deeply

99
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,879
yet freely to pursue our goals with

100
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,680
passion yet without tying our happiness

101
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,760
solely to the outcomes it's about

102
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,000
enjoying the journey without becoming

103
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,239
fixated on the destination by practicing

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,400
non-attachment we learn to Value

105
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,519
experiences relationships and

106
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,159
possessions without allowing them to

107
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,199
Define us or our worth this liberating

108
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,880
principle helps us cultivate a state of

109
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,919
inner contentment and resilience

110
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,800
empowering us to remain unshaken

111
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,160
regardless of external

112
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,160
circumstances it encourages us to live

113
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,000
fully in each moment cherishing our

114
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,160
connections and achievements while being

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,800
prepared to let go when the time comes

116
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,240
knowing that our true Essence remains

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,280
untouched as we journey further into the

118
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,840
heart of Buddhist teachings we arrive at

119
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,639
the beautiful principle of loving

120
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,240
kindness or

121
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,919
meta this principle is not just about

122
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,919

nurturing an unconditional love that

124
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,960
starts within ourselves and radiates

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,320
outwards touching everyone and

126
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,280
everything in our path meta is about

127
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,759
seeing the interconnectedness of all

128
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,680

circumstances it's the antidote to anger

131
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,080
resentment and isolation Building

132
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,360
Bridges where walls once stood by

all beings as we embody meta our hearts

141
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,639
open and we discover that nothing

142
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,960
external can truly affect the Serenity

143
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,080
and love that reside within us it

144
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,240

148
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,880
principle of mindfulness or Sati a

149
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,520
Cornerstone of Buddhist practice that

150
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,319
invites us to be fully present in each

151
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:58,440
moment mindfulness is the art of paying

152
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,639
attention in a particular way on purpose

153
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,759
in the present moment and

154
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,840
non-judgmentally it's about being fully

155
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,440
engaged with whatever we're doing

156
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,800
whether it's eating walking listening or

157
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,120
even Breathing by cultivating

158
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,680
mindfulness we become acutely aware of

159
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,039
our thoughts feelings and Sensations

160
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,759
without getting caught up in them this

161
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,960
heightened awareness allows us to

162
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,440
respond to Life's events with Clarity

163
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,440
and wisdom rather than reacting out of

164
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,080
habit or

165
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,000
emotion mindfulness teaches us to

166
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,440
observe the transient nature of our

167
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,360

00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,319
lives we find that we can remain calm

175
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,680
and centered unaffected by the fleeting

176
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,840
dramas that life throws our

177
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,160
way we then arrive at the heart

178
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,720
expanding principle of compassion or

179
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,400
karuna this principle goes beyond mere

180
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,520
empathy urging us to actively seek to

181
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,360

fighting their own battle coupled with a

185
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,479
desire to relieve their pain it's about

186
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,080
recognizing the interconnectedness of

187
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,680
all life and responding to it with

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,840
kindness and

189
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,039
care when we cultivate compassion we not

190
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,400

own troubles become lighter and we

210
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,720
of the middleway a fundamental Concept

211
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,199
in Buddhism that advocates for a

212
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,159
balanced approach to life avoiding the

213
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:23,520
extremes of self-indulgence and

214
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,520
self-denial this principle is rooted in

215
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,360
the Buddha's own experience as he

216
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,520
discovered that true Enlightenment and

217
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,800
happiness are found not in austerity or

218
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,680
excess but in a harmonious

219
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,800

220
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:43,039
find our own equilibrium in all aspects

221
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:45,320
of life from our work and relationships

222
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,959
to our spiritual practices and leisure

223
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,279
activities it teaches us to be flexible

224
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,959
