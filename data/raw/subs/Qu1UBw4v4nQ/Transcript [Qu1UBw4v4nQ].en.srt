10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,160
of fear and anxiety but don't worry this

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,599
journey won't be nearly as scary as that

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,280
time you thought a ghost was in your

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,840
closet only to find out it was just a

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,360
shirt you never

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,879
wear no I'm not here to tell you to

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,480
Simply stop being afraid we all know

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,920
that works about as well as telling a

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,879
cat not to knock things off tables

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,320
instead we'll explore some ancient

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,359
wisdom so practical it might blow your

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,760
mind first let me ask you something have

22
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:55,640
you ever been so wrapped up in your

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,760
fears that you missed out on the good

24
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,640
stuff right in front of you like being

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,399
so worried about tripping during a dance

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,239
that you forgot to enjoy the music well

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,799
get ready because I've got a story

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,479
that's going to make you see fear in a

29
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,960
whole new light picture this a man is

30
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,159
running through a forest heart pounding

31
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,360
sweat

32
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:20,640
dripping why because there's a tiger

33
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:24,439
chasing him talk about a Bad Day right

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,759
but wait it gets worse he reaches the

35
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:30,560
edge of a cliff and in his Panic he

36
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,200
loses his footing and Falls luckily or

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,759
maybe not so luckily he manages to grab

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,520
onto a Vine hanging over the cliff

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,880
Edge now if you're thinking this story

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,600
couldn't possibly get any more intense

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,920
hold on to your meditation cushions our

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,640
unfortunate friend looks down only to

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,119
see another tiger pacing at the bottom

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,360
of the cliff looking up at him like he's

45
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,479
a tasty human snack and just when you

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,119
thought things couldn't get any worse he

47
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:02,119
notices two mice one black one white

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,560
gnawing away the vine he's clinging to

49
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:07,079
talk about being caught between a rock

50
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:10,239
and a hard place right or in this case

51
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,680
between two tigers in a very long fall

52
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,879
but here's where it gets interesting in

53
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,239
the midst of all this chaos and danger

54
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,519
our hero spots a wild strawberry growing

55
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:23,360
on The Cliff face and what does he do he

56
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:26,680
plucks it and Pops it into his mouth now

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,400
I know what you're thinking Matt my dude

58
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,400
what does this Bonker story have to do

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,400
with overcoming fear and and

60
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,599
anxiety well my friends that's exactly

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,400
what we're going to unpack today this

62
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,120
little tale is like a Swiss army knife

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,959
of Buddhist wisdom it's got all the

64
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,519
tools we need to start tackling our

65
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:47,360
fears so are you ready to turn your

66
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,280
paper tigers into playful kittens to

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,879
transform your Cliffs of Despair into

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,519
mole Hills of opportunity then let's

69
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,519
dive in and discover how the Buddha's

70
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,080
ancient wisdom can help us modern-day

71
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,400
anxious adventurers find a little peace

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,200
in our wild world

by the end of this video you'll be

74
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,640
savoring life's strawberries even when

75
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,920
it feels like everything's going

76
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,480
bananas now let's break down this wild

77
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,400
ride of a story our protagonist is

78
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,640
literally stuck between a rock and a

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,959
hard place or should I say between two

80
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,720
very hungry tigers and a very long fall

81
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,360
it's like the universe decided to play a

82
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,879
cosmic game of would you rather with

83
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,159
this poor guy's life but here's the

84
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:32,239
kicker in the middle of what's probably

85
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,439
the worst day of his life he takes a

86
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,560
moment to enjoy a strawberry a

87
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,680
strawberry can you imagine being in that

88
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,560
situation and thinking you know what

89
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,200
would make this better a snack but

90
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,640
that's exactly what he does this my

91
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,400
friends is what the Buddha was talking

92
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,159
about when he spoke of mindfulness and

93
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,560
living in the present moment our guy in

94
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:56,200
the story can't change his past he can't

95
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,840
unun into that forest or unfall off that

96
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,680
Cliff he also can't control his future

97
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,280
those Tigers aren't going anywhere and

98
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,040
those mice are determined to turn that

99
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,079
vine into dental floss but what he can

100
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,840
control is his present moment he can

101
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:12,319
choose to spend his last moments in

102
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,840
panic and regret or he can choose to

103
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,440
fully experience the sweetness of that

104
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,400
strawberry it's like he's saying well if

105
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,919
this is my last meal it might as well be

106
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,199
a good one now I'm not saying we should

107
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,919
all go out and put ourselves in

108
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,360
life-threatening situations just to

109
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:29,720
appreciate our snacks more but think

110
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,240
about it how often do we miss out on the

111
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,160
the strawberries in our own lives

112
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,199
because we're too busy worrying about

113
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,520
the

114
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,440
Tigers this brings us to another piece

115
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,479
of Buddha's wisdom that's perfect for

116
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,800
our fear busting toolkit the parable of

117
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,160
the two

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,960
arrows now don't worry we're not

119
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,440
actually going to be shooting any arrows

120
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,759
today this is more of a metaphorical

121
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,880
archery

122
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,600
lesson imagine this you're minding your

123
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,240
own business maybe scrolling through

124
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,639
social media or trying to figure out if

125
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,840
it's too late to start that load of

126
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,800
laundry when suddenly ouch you've been

127
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,479
hit by an arrow that's going to leave a

128
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,360
mark right now in this story that first

129
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:12,560
Arrow represents the unavoidable Pains

130
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,720
of life it could be anything a breakup

131
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,120
losing your job or realizing you're out

132
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,160
of coffee on a Monday morning these

133
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,800
things happen and they hurt that's just

134
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,280
part of Being Human but here's where it

135
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,800
gets interesting Buddha says that often

136
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,400
we end up shooting ourselves with a

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,360
second Arrow this second arrow is all

138
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,919
the extra suffering we pile on top of

139
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,199
the original pain it's the Y me the this

140
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,440
always happens the I'll never recover

141
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,720
from this thoughts that we torture

142
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,440
ourselves with it's like stubbing your

143
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,440
toe and then deciding to drop a brick on

144
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,759
it for good measure ouch right but

145
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,960
here's the kicker while we often can't

146
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,440
avoid the first Arrow the second one is

147
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,000
totally optional let's bring this back

148
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,400
to our fear and anxiety often the thing

149
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,479
we're afraid of is that first Arrow but

150
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,560
all the worrying the sleepless nights

151
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,199
the stress eating or is that just me

152
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,360
that's us repeatedly shooting ourselves

153
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,370
with that second Arrow before the first

154
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,680
one is even

155
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,120
[Music]

156
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,639
hit so how do we stop this archery

157
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,639
practice from Hell well my Fearless

158
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,080
friends it's time to introduce Buddha's

159
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,039
top three fear busting techniques think

160
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,280
of these as your spiritual Swiss army

161
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,039
knife handy tools to whip out whenever

162
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,800
fear and anxiety start creeping in first

163
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:30,680
up we've got mindfulness meditation now

164
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,840
I know what you're thinking

165
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,960
Matt Are you seriously telling me to sit

166
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,039
still and breathe when I'm freaking out

167
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,960
and the answer is kind of yeah but hear

168
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,720
me out mindfulness isn't about zoning

169
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,880
out or floating away on a cloud of

170
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,560
Tranquility it's about tuning in to

171
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,960
what's happening right now typically by

172
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,960
focusing on your breath or bodily

173
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,680
Sensations it's like putting your brain

174
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,680
through a car wash all those muddy

175
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,520
anxious thoughts get a good scrubbing

176
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,720
leaving you with a clearer

177
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,319
perspective and the best part you don't

178
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,720
need any fancy equipment or a

179
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,240
Mountaintop Retreat you can do it right

hiding in the bathroom at work not that

182
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,199
I've ever done

183
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,440
that next on our fear busting Hit List

184
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,319

about being Fearless it's about learning

263
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,320
to dance with your fears rather than

264
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:47,040
letting them lead and hey if you stumble

eaters

272
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,000
now here's where Buddha throws us a

273
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,600
curveball that will make M Knight

274
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Shyamalan jealous what if I told you

275
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,839
that the goal isn't to eliminate fear

276
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,200
but to embrace it plot

277
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,680
twist that's right folks Buddha's Secret

278
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,800
Sauce isn't about becoming Fearless it's

279
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,440
about becoming fear friendly it's like

280
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,800
inviting that annoying neighbor over for

281
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,360
dinner instead of hiding behind the

282
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,440
couch when they knock except in this

283
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,959
case the annoying neighbor is your own

284
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:35,240
mind fun times right but here's the

285
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:37,560
thing fear when we look at it closely is

286
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,200
often just trying to protect us it's

287
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,560
like that overzealous bodyguard who

288
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,519
tackles you to the ground when someone

289
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,079
sneezes nearby a bit extra sure but its

290
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,279
heart's in the right place let me share

291
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:51,680
a personal story a while back I was

292
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,320
terrified of public speaking the thought

293
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,959
of standing in front of a crowd made me

294
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,680
want to hide in a cave and become a

295
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,839
Hermit but instead of running away I

296
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,360
decided to lean into it

297
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,720
I joined a local Toast Masters Club and

298
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,240
let me tell you that first speech was a

299
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,399
disaster I was shaking like a leaf in a

300
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,680
hurricane and I'm pretty sure I invented

301
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:14,240
a new language with all my stuttering

302
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,440
but here's the kicker I didn't die the

303
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,560
world didn't end and believe it or not

304
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,199
some people even said they enjoyed it

305
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,560
though they might have just been being

306
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:26,040
nice by facing my fear headon I learned

307
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,160
that it wasn't as scary as I'd built it

308
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,440
up to be in my head that's the beauty of

309
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,160
embracing

310
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,800
fear when we stop running from it and

311
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,680
start listening to it we often find that

312
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,279
it has something valuable to teach us

313
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,360
maybe it's showing us where we need to

314
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,959
grow or what's really important to us or

315
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,959
maybe it's just reminding us that we're

316
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,880
alive and human so the next time fear

317
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:52,560
comes knocking instead of slamming the

318
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,279
door in its face try inviting it in for

319
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,519
a cup of tea you might be surprised at

320
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,279
the conversation that follows who knows

321
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,920
that fear might just become your newest

322
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:05,800
weirdest friend and let's face it we

323
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,920
could all use a few more weird friends

324
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,760
right now I know what you're thinking

325
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,440
that's all well and good Matt but what

326
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,360
about when anxiety hits me like a ton of

327
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,320
bricks and I can't even remember my own

328
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:21,199
name let alone some fancy Buddhist

329
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,360
wisdom don't worry I've got you covered

330
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:25,320

332
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,920
brain decides to throw a panic party and

333
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,519
forgot to invite your rational

334
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:37,160
thinking first up we've got the good old

335
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:40,800

341
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,680

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,759
timeout plus if anyone asks what you're

350
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,959
