1
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:09,916
the Buddha was born a Hindu prince

2
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:11,583
raised in Hindu traditions

3
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:14,375
and yet created a philosophy that challenged

4
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,958
fundamental Hindu beliefs

5
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:19,916
some Hindus even consider Buddha an Avatar of Vishnu

6
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,333
two ancient spiritual paths

7
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,291
one embracing the eternal self

8
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,583
the other rejecting it entirely

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
what if the path to enlightenment

10
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,583
requires abandoning our most cherished belief

11
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,750
how did these traditions diverge

12
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,291
and why do millions still debate

13
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,541
which path leads to true liberation

14
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,875
welcome to Buddha's wisdom

15
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,208
I'm Peter and today

16
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,666
we're exploring the fascinating

17
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,583
relationship between Hinduism

18
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,750
and Buddhism

19
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:55,041
two spiritual traditions that shaped the east

20
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,916
and now captivate the west

21
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,541
while they share geographical origins

22
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:02,875
and certain practices their core philosophies

23
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,666
reveal dramatically different visions of reality

24
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,500
suffering and liberation

25
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,500
my own journey with these traditions began 20 years ago

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,250
when I stumbled into a Hindu temple in southern India

27
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:19,208
mesmerized by the rituals and devotion

28
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,000
years later a 10 day

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,333
silent Buddhist meditation retreat

30
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,625
showed me a completely different approach to spiritual

31
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:30,125
practice the contrast between these experiences

32
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,750
sparked questions I'm still exploring today

33
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,500
I've spent years studying these traditions

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,166
and what fascinates me most

35
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,375
isn't just their philosophical differences

36
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,000
but how they've shaped the lives of billions

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,125
across history

38
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,958
whether you're meditating in a yoga class

39
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,958
or practicing mindfulness for stress reduction

40
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,583
you're touching practices from these ancient

41
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:52,833
wisdom traditions

42
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,208
think of them as spiritual siblings

43
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,708
raised in the same household

44
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,208
but taking very different paths in life

45
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,375
one embraces the divine in countless forms

46
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:06,958
while the other as we discussed in a previous video

47
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,875
questions whether gods matter at all

48
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,916
one celebrates the eternal soul

49
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,750
while the other considers this our greatest delusion

50
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,208
the Dhammapada one of Buddhism's most revered texts

51
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,041
states

52
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:35,708
meanwhile the Hindu Bhagavad Gita teaches

53
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,791
these contrasting views

54
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,375
reflect the fascinating tension

55
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,583
between these traditions

56
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,333
that continue to guide billions of people worldwide

57
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,583
together we'll uncover the surprising connections

58
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,375
and profound differences between these traditions

59
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,291
whether you're new to eastern philosophy

60
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,458
or have practiced meditation for years

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,291
this exploration

62
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,666
will deepen your understanding of both paths

63
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,875
and perhaps your own spiritual journey

64
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,041
let's start at the beginning

65
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,000
not just the beginning of Buddhism

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,083
but the vibrant world that shaped it

67
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,791
picture northern India 2,500 years ago

68
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,375
bustling trade routes connecting diverse kingdoms

69
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,250
forests filled with spiritual seekers

70
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,500
and marketplaces echoing with philosophical debates

71
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,250
Hinduism though it wasn't called that yet

72
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,083
had already existed for thousands of years

73
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,916
the ancient Vedic traditions featured elaborate rituals

74
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:49,458
a complex pantheon of gods and a rigid social structure

75
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,291
this was the world Siddhartha Gautama was born into

76
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,541
you might remember how the sheltered

77
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,333
prince of the Shakya clan

78
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,791
left his palace in what is now Nepal abandoning

79
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,750
luxury to seek deeper truths

80
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:07,041
he was raised as a Hindu educated in Hindu scriptures

81
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,750
and expected to follow Hindu customs

82
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,875
the religious texts he studied

83
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,875
the Vedas and Upanishads

84
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,791
shaped his understanding of the world

85
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:20,250
the Upanishads were particularly significant

86
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,958
these philosophical texts

87
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:25,166
questioned the ritualistic aspects of Vedic religion

88
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,416
and explored profound concepts

89
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,458
like Brahman the ultimate reality

90
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,708
and Atman the eternal self

91
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,333
one famous passage from the Chandogya Upanishad

92
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,166
declares Tat Tvam asi

93
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,708
you are that meaning your true self

94
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,916
is one with the ultimate reality

95
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,541
despite his privileged upbringing

96
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,250
or perhaps because of it

97
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,750
Siddhartha began questioning these traditions

98
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,791
after witnessing sickness

99
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,500
old age and death beyond his palace walls

100
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,500
he abandoned his royal life

101
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,375
to seek answers to suffering

102
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,166
what's fascinating

103
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,125
is that Buddha didn't set out to create a new religion

104
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,166
he was simply a Hindu seeker

105
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,083
following established practices of his time

106
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,916
he studied with prominent Hindu teachers

107
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,666
mastered meditation techniques

108
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,166
and practiced extreme asceticism

109
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,791
starving himself nearly to death

110
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,416
in pursuit of enlightenment

111
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,166
when these approaches failed him

112
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,625
he developed a middle way

113
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,958
between indulgence and asceticism

114
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,875
sitting beneath the Bodhi Tree

115
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,750
he attained enlightenment

116
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,833
and began sharing his insights

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,958
Buddha's teachings

118
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,333
weren't a complete rejection of Hinduism

119
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,833
but rather a reform movement within it

120
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:49,000
he accepted many Hindu concepts like karma

121
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:52,916
rebirth and the goal of liberation from suffering

122
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,583
but he radically reinterpreted others

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,125
he rejected the authority of the Vedas

124
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,750
questioned the caste system

125
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,875
and denied the existence of an

126
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,333
eternal soul for many Hindus

127
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:09,083
these were revolutionary even heretical ideas

128
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,791
this rejection of caste hierarchy

129
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,916
planted seeds for social reform

130
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,208
that would flower centuries later

131
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,958
while orthodox Hinduism maintained the Varna system

132
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:23,458
movements within Hinduism eventually challenged rigid

133
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,250
caste divisions too

134
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,875
the medieval Bakti movement saw Hindu saints

135
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,541
like Mirabai and Kabir

136
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,958
declare that devotion transcended birth status

137
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,125
today both traditions

138
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,000
continue wrestling with Equality and inclusion

139
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,000
though from different starting points

140
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,708
Buddhism's foundational challenge to social hierarchy

141
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,625
versus Hinduism's gradual reform from within

142
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,416
as the Buddhist scholar Richard Gombrich puts it

143
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:55,083
the Buddha was a radical critic of brahmanical religion

144
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,416
but worked with its concepts

145
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,000
doing what we might call judo with ideas

146
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,583
rather than wrestling with them

147
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,083
this context helps explain why Buddhism

148
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,666
eventually faded in India

149
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,375
while flourishing elsewhere

150
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,458
imagine walking through ancient Nalanda University

151
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,750
in the 5th century where Hindu and Buddhist

152
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,833
scholars debated in packed halls

153
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,250
one tradition survived in its homeland

154
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,791
adapting and evolving

155
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,916
while the other spread its influence across Asia

156
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,625
transforming cultures from Sri Lanka to Japan

157
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,875
as we'll discover throughout this video

158
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,500
Hinduism proved remarkably adaptable

159
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,833
even incorporating aspects of Buddhist thought

160
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,125
while reasserting traditional beliefs

161
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,500
the relationship between these traditions

162
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,625
remains complex to this day

163
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,916
with some Hindus claiming Buddha as their own

164
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,208
while maintaining fundamentally

165
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,000
different views about the nature of reality

166
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,416
and the path to spiritual freedom

167
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,875
now that we understand their shared beginnings

168
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,708
let's explore the most profound

169
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,916
philosophical divide between them

170
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,833
the question of whether we have an eternal soul

171
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,125
at the heart of Hindu philosophy

172
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,625
lies a profound concept Atman

173
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,166
the eternal unchanging self or soul

174
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,625
this isn't just another teaching

175
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,291
for Hindus

176
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:26,041
it represents the fundamental truth of existence

177
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,208
The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad

178
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,250
one of Hinduism's oldest texts

179
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,458
declares

180
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,541
this short but powerful

181
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:40,208
statement encapsulates a central Hindu belief

182
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,041
that our true self Atman

183
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:47,458
is identical with the ultimate cosmic reality Brahman

184
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,625
for Hindus recognizing this truth

185
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,625
that your innermost essence is divine and eternal

186
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,166
leads to spiritual liberation

187
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,166
your body may die but your soul continues its journey

188
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,750
through many lifetimes

189
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,916
until it realizes its divine nature

190
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,083
and merges with the cosmic whole

191
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,791
now the Buddha took this foundational concept

192
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,291
and did something radical

193
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:16,791
he didn't just modify it he completely rejected it

194
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,291
the concept of emptiness lies at Buddhism's core

195
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,250
the radical idea that reality lacks inherent

196
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,625
independent existence

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,625
this principle extends to our sense of self

198
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,041
the Buddha taught Anatta no self

199
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,041
declaring that what we experience as a permanent "I"

200
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,750
is actually an illusion

201
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:40,416
the Buddha said in the Samyutta Nikaya form feeling

202
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,416
perception

203
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:45,750
mental formations and consciousness are not self

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,375
if they were self they would not lead to affliction

205
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,875
and it would be possible to control them

206
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,291
saying let these be thus

207
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,000
let these not be thus

208
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,416
but since they are not self

209
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,083
they lead to affliction

210
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,833
and it isn't possible to control them

211
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,625
so what are we according to Buddhism

212
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,250
if not an eternal soul

213
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:10,416
we're a temporary collection of five aggregates

214
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,416
form sensation perception

215
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,291
mental formations and consciousness

216
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,500
all constantly changing

217
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,166
arising and dissolving like waves on water

218
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,666
this creates Buddhism's famous rebirth paradox

219
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,708
how can rebirth occur without something being reborn

220
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,000
the Buddha offered a practical answer

221
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,958
what continues is not a soul but causal connections

222
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,500
imagine lighting one candle from another

223
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,458
the flame continues

224
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:45,625
but no unchanging essence transfers between them

225
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,500
it simply cause and effect

226
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,083
flowing from moment to moment

227
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,625
life to life one moment conditions the next

228
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,333
one life influences the next

229
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,625
without requiring a permanent self to bridge them

230
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,541
like a river that maintains continuity

231
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,500
while constantly changing

232
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,583
our consciousness streams Onward

233
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,833
shaped by our actions

234
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,250
but never fixed as a permanent entity

235
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,500
this difference isn't just academic

236
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,833
it completely transforms how each tradition approaches

237
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,125
spiritual practice

238
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,583
if you follow Hindu teachings

239
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,000
your goal is to realize your true nature

240
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,250
to understand that

241
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,375
beneath your changing thoughts and feelings

242
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,833
exists an eternal divine essence

243
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,125
meditation and yoga serve to peel away the layers

244
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,875
obscuring the self knowledge

245
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,791
but if you practice Buddhism

246
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:36,541
you meditate

247
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,166
to see through the illusion of a permanent self

248
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:44,500
to recognize that what you call I is actually a process

249
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,833
not a thing there's no unchanging core to discover

250
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,208
only the liberating recognition

251
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,791
that the self you've been defending

252
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,833
promoting and worrying about

253
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,875
doesn't actually exist in the way you thought

254
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,500
the implications are enormous

255
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,833
consider how we respond to insults

256
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,000
if someone criticizes you

257
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,333
a Hindu perspective might suggest

258
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,041
they're not criticizing my true self

259
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,791
only my temporary physical or mental attribute

260
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,666
meanwhile a Buddhist view might be

261
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,791
who exactly is being insulted here

262
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,041
there's no permanent me to be offended

263
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,041
just temporary thoughts and feelings

264
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,833
arising in response to words

265
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,833
both approaches can reduce suffering

266
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,083
but through completely different understandings

267
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,166
of reality

268
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,875
consider how differently followers might approach grief

269
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:38,375
when a loved one dies a Hindu might find comfort

270
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,625
knowing their eternal soul continues its journey

271
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,958
a Buddhist might focus on accepting impermanence

272
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,625
as the nature of all things

273
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,250
same human experience

274
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,125
completely different frameworks for processing it

275
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,833
this philosophical divide created practical differences

276
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:58,041
too Hinduism developed elaborate rituals

277
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,625
to purify and protect the soul in its journey

278
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,041
Buddhism seeing no soul to protect

279
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,458
focused instead

280
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,291
on practices to see through the illusion of permanence

281
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,125
interestingly both traditions

282
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,083
eventually developed similar meditation techniques

283
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,291
despite their different philosophies

284
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:21,000
a Hindu might meditate to discover the Atman within

285
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,791
while a Buddhist might use almost identical practices

286
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,625
to confirm no Atman exists at all

287
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,125
this tension between self and no self

288
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,291
appears in how each tradition views enlightenment

289
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,833
for Hindus

290
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:38,750
moksha means the liberation of the individual soul

291
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,875
and its reunion with Brahman

292
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,708
for Buddhists Nirvana

293
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,250
involves

294
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,083
extinguishing the very illusion of a separate self

295
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,250
is one view right and one wrong

296
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,916
that's not for me to say

297
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,625
but understanding this fundamental difference

298
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,041
helps explain why

299
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,708
despite their common origins and similar practices

300
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,166
these traditions

301
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,458
developed such distinct approaches to spiritual life

302
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,958
and while this philosophical divide might seem abstract

303
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,125
it leads directly to different understandings of gods

304
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:16,291
worship and the role of devotion in spiritual life

305
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,833
which brings us to our next chapter

306
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,125
enter a Hindu temple

307
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,541
and you might encounter hundreds of deities

308
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,500
colorful multi armed figures

309
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,000
representing different aspects of the divine

310
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,541
Krishna playing his flute

311
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,041
Ganesha with his elephant head

312
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,791
Kali with her necklace of skulls

313
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,291
this rich pantheon reflects a core Hindu belief

314
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,583
that the ultimate reality

315
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,916
Brahman manifests in countless forms

316
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,500
as the Rig Veda Hinduism's oldest text states

317
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,750
"Ekam Sat Vipra Bahudha Vadanti"

318
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,333
truth is one the wise call it by many names

319
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,500
for Hindus these deities aren't separate gods

320
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,291
but various expressions of a single divine reality

321
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,000
like how white light splits into many colors

322
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,041
through a prism

323
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,291
now walk into a traditional Buddhist temple

324
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,458
and you'll find a very different scene

325
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,208
in early Buddhism you wouldn't see gods at all

326
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,958
just images of the Buddha

327
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,250
and symbols like the Dharma wheel

328
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,458
why

329
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,375
because the Buddha considered questions about deities

330
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,916
largely irrelevant to ending suffering

331
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,958
when asked about the existence of gods

332
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,750
the Buddha often remained silent

333
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,875
or redirected the conversation

334
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,416
one famous text the Tevijja Sutta

335
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,708
shows the Buddha responding to questions

336
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,666
about reaching union with Brahma

337
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,458
a creator god by saying

338
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,000
none of the brahmins has seen Brahma face to face

339
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,416
so their teaching is baseless

340
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,500
the Buddha didn't explicitly deny God's existed he

341
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,916
acknowledged various devas

342
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:00,125
or divine beings but considered them temporary

343
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,916
residents of higher realms

344
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,708
still caught in the cycle of rebirth

345
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,000
still subject to suffering

346
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,875
still lacking true wisdom

347
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:13,000
unlike the omnipotent creator god of other traditions

348
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,541
Buddhist devas are more like longer lived

349
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,000
more powerful versions of humans

350
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,208
this difference affects how followers approach

351
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,583
spiritual practice

352
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,291
Hinduism embraces bhakti devotional worship

353
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,958
as a primary path to liberation

354
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,750
by loving and surrendering to a chosen deity ishta-devata

355
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,750
devotees can transcend ego

356
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,000
and realize their unity with the divine

357
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,541
Buddhism meanwhile

358
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,333
emphasizes personal effort and insight

359
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,708
the Buddha said in his final teaching

360
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,166
be a lamp unto yourselves

361
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:52,833
be your own refuge hold fast to the truth as a lamp

362
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,041
hold fast as a refuge to the truth

363
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,083
this difference extends to ritual practice itself

364
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,625
Hinduism preserved elaborate ceremonies

365
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,875
requiring precise execution

366
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,833
fire offerings mantra recitation

367
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,333
and life cycle sacraments performed by trained priests

368
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,958
early Buddhism by contrast

369
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,500
streamlined ritual elements

370
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,250
focusing on ethical conduct and meditation

371
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,750
rather than complex ceremonies

372
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,500
the Buddha often critiqued empty ritualism

373
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,958
without understanding

374
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,666
when a brahmin described elaborate fire rituals

375
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:30,708
the Buddha responded

376
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:34,416
that the true sacred fire was the disciplined mind

377
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,625
and true offerings were virtuous actions

378
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:42,291
this practical approach made Buddhism accessible beyond

379
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,500
priestly circles though later

380
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,458
Buddhist traditions

381
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,000
would develop their own ritual complexities

382
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,291
this doesn't mean Buddhists never pray

383
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,541
or engage in devotional practices

384
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,875
as Buddhism spread across Asia

385
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,083
it incorporated local deities

386
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,083
and developed devotional elements

387
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,375
in pure land Buddhism for

388
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,875
instance devotees call upon Amitabha Buddha

389
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,625
for rebirth in his paradise

390
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,041
and in Tibetan Buddhism

391
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,500
deities serve as meditation focal points

392
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,500
embodiments of qualities practitioners seek to develop

393
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,250
even the Buddha's status evolved

394
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,958
though he never claimed to be divine

395
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,833
and explicitly identified as a human teacher

396
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,916
many Buddhists came to Revere him as something beyond

397
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,958
ordinary humanity this parallels

398
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,333
how certain Hindu traditions view great sages

399
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,875
and teachers in Mahayana Buddhism

400
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,166
the concept of Buddhahood

401
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,333
expanded to include multiple Buddhas

402
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,750
across time and space

403
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,791
remember our video who is Maitreya

404
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,833
this tradition of future Buddhas

405
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:53,291
creates an interesting parallel with Hindu avatars

406
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,250
divine beings who manifest in different forms

407
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,916
throughout cosmic cycles

408
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,458
some Hindu traditions even incorporated the Buddha

409
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,500
himself as the ninth Avatar of Vishnu

410
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,750
as we discussed in our video

411
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,833
this creative theological move

412
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:13,625
effectively claimed Buddhism as a subset of Hinduism

413
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,333
though with the ironic twist

414
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,958
that this Avatar supposedly taught false doctrines

415
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,958
to test the faithful or mislead demons

416
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,625
during medieval India

417
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,875
an extraordinary convergence occurred

418
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,208
both traditions developed tantric practices

419
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,458
with striking similarities

420
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,875
despite their different philosophical foundations

421
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,416
both traditions used visualization of deities

422
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,958
as a spiritual technique

423
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,791
though with different ultimate goals

424
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,791
so while Hinduism might be described as polytheistic

425
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,583
monotheistic or even henotheistic

426
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,083
depending on the tradition

427
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,000
and Buddhism might range from non theistic

428
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,958
to practically polytheistic

429
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,166
these labels oversimplify

430
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,291
complex approaches to divinity

431
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,791
what matters most isn't just whether gods exist

432
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,041
but how concepts of the divine

433
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,208
shape our understanding of

434
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,833
suffering and liberation

435
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,791
which brings us to the heart of both traditions

436
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,500
and our next chapter

437
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,041
life hurts this simple truth

438
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,791
forms the foundation of both Hindu

439
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,666
and Buddhist thought we all experience physical pain

440
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,125
heartbreak loss and eventually death

441
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,000
but why must we suffer

442
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,833
and can we ever truly overcome it

443
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,500
both traditions address these questions

444
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,250
but with different diagnoses and prescriptions

445
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
let's start with their shared concepts

446
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,375
before exploring their distinct approaches

447
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,041
both Hinduism and Buddhism

448
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:49,291
recognize the cycle of rebirth Samsara

449
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,833
where beings move through repeated lives

450
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,750
according to their karma as we explained in our video

451
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,666
Samsara explained

452
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:01,333
this isn't a single life followed by heaven or hell

453
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,125
but an ongoing process spanning countless existences

454
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,000
the Hindu text Bhagavad Gita describes it

455
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,583
just as a person casts off worn out garments

456
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,500
and puts on others that are new

457
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,041
even so does the embodied soul

458
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,708
cast off worn out bodies

459
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,833
and take on others that are new

460
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,458
similarly both traditions

461
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,125
view karma as the moral law of cause and effect

462
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,416
actions create consequences

463
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,291
that shape future experiences

464
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,416
either in this life or beyond

465
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,208
Karma isn't punishment or reward from a deity

466
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,500
but an impersonal cosmic principle like gravity

467
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,750
it simply works

468
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,500
but despite these similarities

469
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,958
the traditions diverge in how they understand

470
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:50,000
suffering's root causes and ultimate solutions

471
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,333
for Hinduism suffering stems from ignorance

472
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:57,208
avidya of our true nature as eternal atman

473
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,958
we identify with our temporary bodies and minds

474
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:05,083
rather than recognizing our divine essence this

475
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,583
misidentification causes attachment

476
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:08,750
which leads to suffering

477
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,333
when impermanent things inevitably change

478
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,083
the Hindu solution is moksha

479
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:14,750
liberation

480
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,958
achieved by realizing your identity with Brahman

481
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,583
this can happen through multiple paths

482
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,041
Jnana yoga knowledge

483
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,875
Bhakti yoga devotion

484
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,041
Karma yoga selfless action

485
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,666
or Raja Yoga meditation

486
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,958
the Upanishads declare

487
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:40,000
the knower of Brahman becomes Brahman

488
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,333
Buddhism as covered in our video

489
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,000
about the four noble truths

490
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,500
frame suffering through the four noble truths

491
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,750
First life contains suffering dukkha

492
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:55,416
second suffering stems from craving and attachment

493
00:22:55,791 --> 00:23:00,291
third suffering can end by eliminating its causes

494
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:05,125
fourth the eightfold path leads to suffering cessation

495
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:08,375
the Buddha taught in the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta

496
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,916
this is the noble truth of suffering

497
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:15,000
birth is suffering aging is suffering

498
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:19,541
illness is suffering death is suffering

499
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,916
union with what is displeasing is suffering

500
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:26,333
separation from what is pleasing is suffering

501
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:30,125
not to get what one wants is suffering

502
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,000
notice the key difference

503
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,250
while Hinduism sees suffering as

504
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,500
resulting from not knowing our true self

505
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,875
Buddhism considers the very belief in a permanent self

506
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,166
as the problem we suffer

507
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,958
because we cling to a self

508
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:47,000
that doesn't exist in the way we think

509
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,500
these divergent perspectives create distinct

510
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,833
meditative approaches

511
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:54,500
Hindu yogis often direct attention inward

512
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,000
to discover the silent witness behind thoughts

513
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:00,250
the unchanging I am presence

514
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:04,083
Buddhist practitioners train to observe all experiences

515
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:07,000
as flowing processes noting how sensations

516
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,583
emotions and thoughts continuously emerge

517
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:13,625
change and dissolve without a permanent center

518
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,625
even their ultimate goals differ subtly

519
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:20,083
Hindu moksha typically means liberation from rebirth

520
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,791
with the soul reuniting with Brahman

521
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,833
Buddhist Nirvana also ends rebirth

522
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,166
but without a soul merging with anything

523
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:33,125
it's simply the extinction of the causes of suffering

524
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:36,000
the Buddha described Nirvana by what it's not

525
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,250
there is monks an unborn unbecome

526
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:42,250
unmade unfabricated

527
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:46,875
if there were not that unborn unbecome unmade

528
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
unfabricated there would not be the case

529
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,500
that escape from the born become made

530
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,625
fabricated would be discerned

531
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,125
both traditions

532
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,750
develop sophisticated meditation techniques

533
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,250
for achieving these goals

534
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:05,833
Hinduism gave us yoga not just physical postures

535
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,958
but a comprehensive system for stilling the mind

536
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:12,750
Buddhism contributed mindfulness and Vipassana

537
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,125
practices now popular worldwide

538
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:18,416
what's remarkable is how these distinct philosophies

539
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,750
often led to similar ethical teachings

540
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,208
both emphasize nonviolence

541
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,458
ahimsa truthfulness

542
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:29,083
nonstealing and compassion for all beings

543
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:33,791
the Buddhist metta loving kindness meditation

544
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,666
parallels Hindu practices of universal love

545
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,291
so while their metaphysical frameworks differ

546
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:42,333
both traditions

547
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:45,166
offer practical methods for reducing suffering

548
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:48,458
and cultivating greater awareness and compassion

549
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:52,000
approaches that continue to influence millions of lives

550
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,833
today

551
00:25:57,833 --> 00:26:00,916
both Hinduism and Buddhism began in the same region

552
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:02,500
but their journey since then

553
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,541
reveal a fascinating contrast

554
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:06,916
Buddhism largely vanished from its birthplace

555
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:10,500
by the 12th century while spreading across Asia

556
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:13,333
Hinduism remained rooted in India

557
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:16,583
until global migration carried it worldwide

558
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,208
today these ancient traditions face modern challenges

559
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:23,541
and influence contemporary culture in surprising ways

560
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:28,041
Buddhism entered western awareness in the 19th century

561
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,416
first through scholarly translations

562
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:34,958
then as a philosophical alternative to Christianity

563
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:40,125
by the 1950s writers like Alan Watts and Jack Kerouac

564
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:43,250
popularized Zen Buddhism among counterculture circles

565
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:47,583
the Dalai Lama's exile from Tibet in 1959

566
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:50,000
brought Tibetan Buddhism global attention

567
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:53,833
and by the 21st century mindfulness meditation

568
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:55,750
stripped of religious elements

569
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:57,500
had entered mainstream health care

570
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,291
education and corporate settings

571
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:03,125
Hinduism's western journey followed a different path

572
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:06,125
Swami Vivekananda introduced Hindu philosophy

573
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,500
at the 1893 World Parliament of religions

574
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,666
in Chicago

575
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:13,083
later yoga

576
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:16,416
originally one branch of Hindu spiritual practice

577
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,083
transformed into a global fitness phenomenon

578
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,583
the Beatles'interest in Transcendental meditation

579
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:26,083
in the 1960s sparked

580
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:29,375
wider curiosity about Hindu meditation techniques

581
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:32,500
but these traditions didn't just spread

582
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,750
they transformed

583
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,125
Western Buddhism often emphasizes meditation

584
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:41,625
and psychology while downplaying rebirth and cosmology

585
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:45,500
western yoga frequently focuses on physical postures

586
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,875
with little reference to its spiritual roots

587
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,375
these adaptations have created misunderstandings

588
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,000
many Westerners practice mindfulness

589
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,791
without realizing its Buddhist origins

590
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,916
or attend yoga classes

591
00:27:58,916 --> 00:28:00,958
without knowing their performing postures

592
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:03,208
developed for spiritual awakening

593
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,125
meanwhile both traditions

594
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:07,833
continue evolving in their Asian heartlands

595
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:09,333
in Thailand

596
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,875
socially engaged Buddhism addresses contemporary issues

597
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:17,875
like environmentalism and economic inequality

598
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:21,833
in India Hindu traditions respond to modernization

599
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,916
while maintaining ancient practices

600
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,291
perhaps most interesting

601
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:27,458
is how these traditions

602
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:30,250
have begun to influence each other again

603
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:33,750
some modern Hindu teachers incorporate

604
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,750
Buddhist mindfulness practices

605
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
alongside traditional devotions

606
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,250
Buddhist centers occasionally

607
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,458
offer yoga classes that connect postures to meditation

608
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,916
and western spiritual seekers

609
00:28:45,916 --> 00:28:48,083
often blend elements from both traditions

610
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,166
attending Vipassana retreats one month

611
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:52,000
and Hindu kirtan the next

612
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:54,916
is this cultural appropriation

613
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:57,791
or the natural evolution of spiritual traditions

614
00:28:58,416 --> 00:29:00,000
there's no simple answer

615
00:29:00,666 --> 00:29:02,500
both religions have historically

616
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,375
absorbed influences from cultures they encountered

617
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,666
academic scholar of religion

618
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:08,458
Thomas Tweed

619
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:11,250
suggests religions are not static entities

620
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,708
but cultural flows that constantly cross boundaries

621
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,958
perhaps what we're seeing is simply the latest chapter

622
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:21,541
in a conversation between these traditions

623
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:23,166
that began with the Buddha himself

624
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:26,666
what's certain is that both Hinduism and Buddhism

625
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:29,625
offer profound insights for our modern world

626
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:32,208
techniques for managing stress

627
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,250
philosophical frameworks for understanding immanence

628
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:38,000
ethical systems

629
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,500
that extend compassion beyond human boundaries

630
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,000
to include all life

631
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:45,125
as we discussed in what if Buddha was a Hindu God

632
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,083
all along

633
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:49,250
the relationship between these traditions

634
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,625
remains complex

635
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:54,041
some Hindus still view Buddhism as a reformed

636
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,708
branch of their own tradition

637
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,708
most Buddhists maintain their distinct identity

638
00:29:58,708 --> 00:30:00,791
while acknowledging their Hindu roots

639
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,375
but beyond theological debates

640
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,458
both traditions address our universal

641
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:07,625
human need to understand suffering

642
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:10,500
and find greater peace and meaning

643
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:13,708
whether through devotion to divine forms

644
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:16,458
or mindful awareness of present experience

645
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:20,208
both offer paths to greater wisdom and compassion

646
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,375
the Dalai Lama often states

647
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:25,791
my religion is kindness this sentiment

648
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:27,916
simple yet profound

649
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,041
perhaps

650
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:32,375
captures what's most valuable in both traditions

651
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:35,833
regardless of their metaphysical differences

652
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:42,916
after exploring these two magnificent

653
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:44,208
spiritual traditions

654
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,208
I keep returning to one fundamental question

655
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:49,041
what does their relationship reveal

656
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:51,041
about the nature of truth itself

657
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:55,083
the Buddha and Hindu sages sought the same goal

658
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:56,500
ultimate truth that liberates

659
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,916
from suffering yet they reached different conclusions

660
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:04,291
one saw an eternal self identical with cosmic reality

661
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,000
the other saw no permanent self at all

662
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,208
can both be right

663
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:10,916
this paradox challenges our binary thinking

664
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:14,250
perhaps these traditions offer complementary

665
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,833
rather than contradictory insights

666
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:19,166
different facets of a reality

667
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:21,416
too vast for any single perspective

668
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:22,958
to capture completely

669
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,125
consider this thought experiment

670
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,125
what if the Buddha were alive today

671
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:31,041
encountering modern Hinduism and Buddhism

672
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,208
would he recognize either

673
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,541
as capturing his original intent

674
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,875
would he see them as different languages

675
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:40,750
describing the same spiritual landscape

676
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,583
or as fundamentally different paths

677
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:45,791
the ancient Hindu text

678
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,583
Rigveda provides a clue with its famous line

679
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:53,833
truth is one the wise call it by many names

680
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,791
this suggests that ultimate reality

681
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,958
transcends our conceptual frameworks entirely

682
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:04,375
perhaps both Buddhism and Hinduism are fingers

683
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:05,458
pointing at the moon

684
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:09,666
useful indicators but not the moon itself

685
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:12,291
this brings us to what scholars call

686
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:13,791
the two truths doctrine

687
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:16,041
a concept found in both traditions

688
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,375
there's conventional truth

689
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:21,583
how things appear and ultimate truth

690
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:26,291
how things actually are both perspectives are necessary

691
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:28,791
like how physics needs both

692
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:31,541
Newtonian mechanics for everyday calculations

693
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,791
and quantum mechanics for deeper understanding

694
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:39,041
Hindu texts describe this dual perspective

695
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,541
through the concept of Maya

696
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:44,500
the world is both real and unreal simultaneously

697
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:46,750
the Katha Upanishad states

698
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:49,000
what is here is also there

699
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,833
what is there is also here

700
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:55,041
whoever sees difference here goes from death to death

701
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,875
similarly the Buddhist Heart Sutra declares

702
00:32:58,875 --> 00:32:59,916
form is emptiness

703
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:02,416
emptiness is form suggesting

704
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:03,708
apparent contradictions

705
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:06,250
resolve at deeper levels of understanding

706
00:33:06,916 --> 00:33:09,583
I've come to believe we're asking the wrong question

707
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:11,916
when debating which tradition is correct

708
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,541
the deeper wisdom might lie

709
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:17,000
not in choosing between self and no self

710
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:20,125
but in understanding how these concepts shape

711
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:23,000
our moment to moment experience of being alive

712
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:24,500
modern practitioners

713
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,625
often find value in both approaches

714
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:30,250
using Hindu devotional practices to open the heart

715
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:34,041
and Buddhist mindfulness to see through delusion

716
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,250
rather than conflicting

717
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:39,291
these practices can complement each other

718
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:43,750
creating a more complete spiritual tool kit

719
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:47,583
what matters most isn't theological purity

720
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:49,250
but practical results

721
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,666
do these teachings help us suffer less

722
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:55,333
do they make us more compassionate

723
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:58,375
do they bring greater clarity and peace

724
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,416
as one ancient story tells us

725
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:04,000
a group of blind men encountered an elephant

726
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,208
each touched a different part tusk

727
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,416
trunk leg

728
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:14,708
tail and declared the elephant to be like a spear snake

729
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:19,166
pillar or rope each was partially right

730
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:21,041
based on their limited perspective

731
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,500
yet none grasped the whole elephant

732
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,083
perhaps Hinduism and Buddhism

733
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:28,375
are touching different aspects of truth

734
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:31,166
their differences don't invalidate either

735
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,208
but remind us that reality exceeds

736
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:37,041
our ability to conceptualize it completely

737
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:40,500
and that might be the most valuable lesson of all

738
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,166
in a world

739
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:44,291
increasingly fragmented by ideological divisions

740
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,666
these ancient traditions remind us that

741
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:49,791
contradictory truths can coexist

742
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:51,791
whether you're drawn to the Hindu

743
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:53,666
recognition of your divine nature

744
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:56,458
or the Buddhist insight that all things

745
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:59,000
including the self are impermanent processes

746
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:02,958
both paths lead toward freedom from suffering

747
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:08,416
if this exploration has opened new perspectives for you

748
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:11,000
help us continue these philosophical journeys

749
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,166
by subscribing to Buddha's wisdom

750
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,625
and hitting the notification bell

751
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:18,416
which aspects of these traditions

752
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,958
speak to your own experience

753
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:22,416
have certain practices from either path

754
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:24,250
transformed your understanding

755
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:27,041
share your story in the comments below

756
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,875
and let us know what other spiritual dialogues

757
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:32,375
you'd like us to explore in future videos

758
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:35,791
until next time

759
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:39,541
may you find wisdom on whatever path calls to you
