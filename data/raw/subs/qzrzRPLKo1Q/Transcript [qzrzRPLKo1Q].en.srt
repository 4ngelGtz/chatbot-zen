option to extend his life choosing

75

instead to relinquish his will to live

of Buddha's age and the harsh conditions

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,919
sukara Mad Dava contained poison either

accidentally or

155
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,840

Buddha symptoms align with natural

161
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,879

163
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:08,360
interestingly Buddha himself seemed to

164
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:12,560
dismiss any notion of Foul Play in his

165
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,560

that preceded his

168
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,400
Enlightenment this statement suggests

169
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,599
Buddha saw his last meal not as a cause

170

of death but as a significant spiritual

00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,039
trees the choice was deliberate Buddha

193
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,840
had been born under a s tree and now he

194
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,840
would pass away between them completing

195
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,479
the circle of his Earthly

196
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,520
existence despite his weakening body

197
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,720
Buddha's mind remained clear he used

198
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,240
used this moment to impart a final

199
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:39,120
lesson on impermanence he told Ananda

200
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,760
all compounded things are subject to

201
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,919
Decay strive with

202
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,680
diligence even in choosing his final

203
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,720
resting place Buddha turned the ACT into

204
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,640
a

205
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,320
teaching the Setting Sun painted the sky

206
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,200
in vibrant Hues as Buddha laid down on

207
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,600
his right side his head facing

208
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:02,720
north the S trees as if sensing the the

209
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,680
momentous occasion burst into unseasonal

210
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,839
bloom showering pale petals upon the

211
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,320
dying

212
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,880
Sage kushinagar once an obscure town was

213
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,640
about to witness an event that would

214
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,440
echo through Millennia the stage was set

215
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:21,279
for Buddha's final teachings his last

216
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:25,200
breaths and his passage into P Nirvana

217
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,200
the ultimate release from the cycle of

218
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,360
[Music]

219
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,680
rebirth as Buddha reclined between the S

220
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,399
trees he seized this final opportunity

221
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:38,200
to impart his most essential teachings

222
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,240
despite his failing body his mind

223
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,000
remained razor sharp his words carrying

224
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,640
the weight of a lifetime's wisdom

225
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,920
kneeling nearby was his devoted disciple

226
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Ananda for decades Ananda had walked

227
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,800
beside Buddha witnessing his teachings

228
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,600
and spreading the Dharma but now as the

229
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,600
end neared ananda's heart was heavy how

230
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,600
could he accept the loss of his teacher

231
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,720
his guide his friend his eyes filled

232
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,120
with unshed tears betrayed the sorrow he

233
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,880
struggled to

234
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,800
contain Buddha ever attuned to the

235
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,000
emotions of those around him turned his

236
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:20,240
gaze to Ananda his voice was soft but

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
steady you have done much good Ananda

238
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,240
you have been by my side through it all

239
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,920
do not let sorrow Cloud your mind the

240
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,839
time for your own Awakening is near

241
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,959
these words so simple yet filled with

242
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,880
profound compassion touched Anand deeply

243
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,399
even in his final moments Buddha was

244
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,920
teaching not just to his assembled

245
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,600
followers but to Ananda personally his

246
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,920
master's final lesson was not about

247
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,639
attachment but letting go of even the

248
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,639
dearest bonds for all things are

249
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,800
impermanent Buddha then began by

250
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,880
addressing the Sanga his community of

251
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,800
monks

252
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,040
if you have any doubt or uncertainty

253
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:09,120
concerning the Buddha the dhama or the

254
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:11,240
sah ask now he urged do not later regret

255
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,760
that you missed this

256
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,920
opportunity his invitation was met with

257
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,880
silence a testament to the clarity of

258
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,800
his teachings over the years Buddha then

259
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,880
delivered what became known as the four

260
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,200
great references these guidelines would

261
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:30,040
ensure that even after his death his

262
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,639
teachings would remain pure and un

263
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,680
changed Buddha wanted to make sure his

264
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,839
message of compassion and mindfulness

265
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,720
would continue without

266
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,200
Distortion he emphasized that after his

267
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,639
passing the monks should always compare

268
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,639
any claimed Buddha's words with the

269
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:51,120
sutas and Vena his recorded teachings

270
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,160
and the monastic

271
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,320
code this would be the Safeguard against

272
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,600
misinterpretation ensuring the Dharma

273
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,760
remained intact for future Generations

274
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,800
in a poignant moment Buddha consoled his

275
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,560
grieving attendant Ananda he praised

276
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,079
ananda's years of loyal service and

277
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,440
encouraged him to strive for his own

278
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:16,959
Enlightenment you have done much good

279
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:20,320
Ananda he said make an effort and soon

280
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,320
you will be free from all

281
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,040
impurities perhaps most importantly

282
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,120
Buddha stressed the transient nature of

283
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,760
existence one last time he reminded his

284
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,720
followers that all compounded things

285
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:36,279
must pass away urging them to find

286
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,839
Liberation through diligent practice

287
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:41,160
these final teachings encapsulated the

288
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,600
essence of Buddha's lifelong message

289
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,720
impermanence

290
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,720
non-attachment and the path to

291
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,240
[Music]

292
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,440
Enlightenment as night fell over

293
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,600
kushinagar Buddha entered his final

294
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,279
hours despite his deteriorating physical

295
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,480
condition he remained fully present his

296
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:05,079
mind as clear as the star-filled sky

297
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:08,360
above but for Ananda standing vigil

298
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:11,560
beside him the reality of his teacher's

299
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,120
impending death weighed heavy on his

300
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,079
heart Ananda had long been Buddha's

301
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,560
right hand the disciple who had served

302
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:22,399
him Faithfully for Years yet now with

303
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:25,199
the end so near he found himself unable

304
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,399
to accept the inevitable tears began to

305
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:28,480
well in his eyes and though he had

306
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:31,279
practiced the teachings of

307
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,639
non-attachment for years this was

308
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,399
different this was the man who had shown

309
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:38,480
him the path to

310
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:41,519
Liberation how could he simply let

311
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,199
go Buddha sensing the turmoil within

312
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,440
Ananda spoke once more his voice filled

313
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,680
with the same compassionate wisdom that

314
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,560
had always guided him Ananda do not

315
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:57,680
mourn me everything that arises must

316
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:59,399
pass away even this body is subject to

317
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,040
decay

318
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,639
what I have taught you is the truth

319
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,440
cling not even to

320
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:09,279
this Ananda though still deeply saddened

321
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,519
felt a wave of Peace wash over him his

322
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,880
master's final words were a bomb for his

323
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:18,639
grief it was a reminder that even the

324
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,959
most precious bonds must one day be

325
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,839
released and in that moment Ananda

326
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,000
understood that the greatest act of love

327
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:28,240
was to let

328
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,279
go during these Precious Moments Buddha

329
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,720
displayed EXT ordinary

330
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:35,639
compassion when he heard that an athetic

331
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,040
named subat wished to speak with him

332
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:42,880
Buddha overruled anand's protective

333
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:45,320
objections let him come Buddha said for

334
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,320
he asks for

335
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,440
enlightenment in his last hours Buddha

336
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,839
still sought to guide others toward

337
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,959
Liberation suba's encounter with the

338
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,720
dying Buddha proved

339
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,480
transformative after a brief discourse

340
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,079
subata became Buddha budd's final direct

341
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,120
disciple finding Enlightenment mere

342
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:07,519
hours before Buddha's passing this last

343
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,920
conversion underscore Buddha's

344
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,720
unwavering commitment to teaching until

345
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,560
his final

346
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,839
breath as midnight approached Buddha

347
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,000
addressed his assembled disciples one

348
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:22,560
last time he encouraged them to continue

349
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,759
their spiritual practice diligently

350
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,560
reminding them that all composite things

351
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:29,920
are subject to dissolution even in these

352
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,759
final moments he embodied the equinity

353
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,040
he had taught throughout his life the

354
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,319
air grew thick with emotion as Buddha's

355
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,279
breaths became

356
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:41,639
shallower his disciples realizing these

357
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,279
were truly the last moments with their

358
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,399
teacher struggled to come to terms with

359
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:49,000
the impermanence Buddha had so often

360
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,399
spoken about the final hour of the

361
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,079
enlightened one had arrived marking the

362
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:57,230
end of an era and the beginning of a

363
00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:00,399
lasting Legacy

364
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,519
[Music]

365
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,319
as the night deepened Buddha entered his

366
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,160
final meditation the assembled disciples

367
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:10,920
watched in reverent silence as their

368
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:13,440
teacher demonstrated one last time the

369
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,800
power of a mind fully

370
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,000
awakened Buddha began to move through

371
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,440
the janas the Deep meditative states he

372
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,160
had mastered decades ago his breathing

373
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,920
slowed his body became still yet a

374
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,959
subtle Radiance seemed to emanate from

375
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,279
him even in his last moments Buddha was

376
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,160
teaching showing how to face death with

377
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,880
complete awareness and

378
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,360
serenity suddenly the Earth trembled a

379
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,000
soft light enveloped the Sal Grove
