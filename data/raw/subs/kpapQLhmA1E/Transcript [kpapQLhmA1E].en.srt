Enlightenment let's begin our journey

with a deep dive into the very essence

39
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,399
of our destination Nirvana

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,840
often enveloped in an aura of mystery

41
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,840
Nirvana is more than just a concept or a

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,000
fleeting moment of happiness it is the

43
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,360
ultimate state of Liberation a profound

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,840
peace that arises from the cessation of

45
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,320
desires and the end of

46
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,040
suffering originating from ancient

47
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,560
Buddhist teachings Nirvana represents

48
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,600
the extinguishing of the fires that fuel

49
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,159
our suffering ignorance attachment and

50
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,200
aversion but what does this mean for you

51
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,799
and me living in the bustling complex

52
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,640
world of the 21st century it means that

53
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,440
Nirvana is not a distant or unattainable

54
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,000
dream reserved for athetics and monks

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,640
alone instead it's a state of being that

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,319
we too can aspire to a beacon of peace

57
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,879
that guides us through the turbulence of

58
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,879
daily life to truly understand Nirvana

59
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,760
we must first acknowledge the nature of

60
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,920
our

61
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,720
existence Life as we know it is

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,400
impermanent and intertwined with

63
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,360
suffering this suffering stems not from

64
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,640
the external World itself but from our

65
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,800
reactions to it from our desires our

66
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,280
fears and our Relentless pursuit of

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,159
impermanent

68
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,519
Pleasures Nirvana is The Liberation from

69
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:53,120
this cycle achieved not by escaping life

70
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,959
but by embracing it fully with awareness

71
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,920
and equinity imagine standing in the eye

72
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:01,159
of a hurricane where everything is calm

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,640
and clear around you the storm rages on

74
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:07,440
but you remain untouched

75
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,480
Serene this is the piece of Nirvana a

76
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,640
state where the external chaos of the

77
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,159
world no longer disturbs your inner

78
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,400
Tranquility it's about finding Stillness

79
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,959
within the storm understanding the

80
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,360
impermanence of all things and releasing

81
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,120
the grasp that desires and aversions

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,959
have on your heart as we embark on the

83
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,640
subsequent steps toward achieving this

84
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,959
Sublime State remember that each step is

85
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,840
a layer of understanding standing a

86
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,560
practice that brings us closer to the

87
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,159
Serene eye of the

88
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,159
storm the path to Nirvana is not a

89
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:41,159
linear Journey but a deepening spiral

90
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:42,920
into the core of our being where true

91
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,239
peace

92
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,599
resides as we venture forth from our

93
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,599
foundational understanding of Nirvana we

94
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,239
arrive at the critical step of

95
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,280
self-reflection this is where the

96
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,120
journey inward begins a pivotal moment

97
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,480
that invites us to turn the lens of

98
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,239
awareness onto

99
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,280
ourselves self-reflection

100
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,560
is the act of delving deep into our own

101
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,239
minds and hearts examining our thoughts

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,840
emotions and motivations with a spirit

103
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,239
of openness and

104
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,200
curiosity it is in essence the art of

105
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,400
becoming intimately familiar with the

106
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,680
inner workings of our own

107
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,360
Consciousness the path to Nirvana is

108
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,199
paved with the stones of self-awareness

109
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,240
it is only by understanding our inner

110
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:28,759
landscape that we can begin to navigate

111
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,840
the complexities of our desires fears

112
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:32,720
and attachments

113
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,840
think of self-reflection as holding a

114
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,919
mirror up to your soul not to judge or

115
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,000
criticize but to observe and

116
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:45,240
understand it is in this introspective

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,039
process that we uncover the roots of our

118
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,880
suffering the ingrained patterns of

119
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:52,160
thought and behavior that tether us to

120
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,639
the cycle of desire and

121
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,000
aversion but how does one embark on this

122
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,680
journey of

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,160
self-reflection it starts with simple

124
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,479
yet profound

125
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,880
practices mindfulness and

126
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,479
meditation by cultivating a regular

127
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,320
practice of sitting in silence observing

128
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,199
our breath and witnessing our thoughts

129
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,400
without attachment we develop the

130
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:17,440
ability to see ourselves more clearly

131
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,199
this Clarity of mind and heart is the

132
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,919
soil in which the seeds of Enlightenment

133
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,360
take root in The Quiet Moments of

134
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,080
reflection we often encounter aspects of

135
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,360
ourselves that are difficult to face our

136
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,360
fears our inse purities and the Shadows

137
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,400
that we've long avoided yet it is

138
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,280
precisely in confronting these Shadows

139
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,479
that we find our greatest growth

140
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,960
opportunities self-reflection is not

141
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,440
about achieving Perfection but about

142
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,880
embracing our Humanity with compassion

143
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,919
and

144
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,880
understanding moreover this

145
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,960
introspective Journey allows us to

146
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,160
discern the transient nature of our

147
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,160
thoughts and feelings we come to realize

148
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,479
that the fleeting contents of our minds

149
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,319
do not Define us but are instead the

150
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,120
vast awareness in which these thoughts

151
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,919
and emotions arise and dissolve this

152
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,880
realization is a liberating Insight one

153
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,880
that brings us closer to the Serene

154
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,440
state of

155
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,759
Nirvana as we continue to explore the

156
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,880
steps toward Enlightenment remember that

157
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,240
self-reflection is an ongoing process a

158
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,720
lifelong journey of Discovery and

159
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,479
understanding it is the foundation upon

160
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,199
which we build our path to Nirvana

161
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,120
Illuminating the way with the light of

162
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,039
our inner

163
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,000

support but also Elevate our

170
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,080
understanding of the mind and the nature

171
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,199
of reality guiding us toward the

172
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,800

they unfold without judgment or

179
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:15,039
attachment it's about savoring the

180
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,240
richness of the now whether you're

181
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,599

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,160
warmth on your skin or noticing the rise

of connection with the world around us

187
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,759
but mindfulness extends Beyond mere

patterns of our mind the habitual

192
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,400
thoughts and reactions that often lead

193
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,000
to suffering with this awareness comes

194
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,199
the ability to choose a different

195
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,720
response one that aligns more closely

196
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,879
with peace and

197
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,560
equinity this is where mindfulness

198
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,720
becomes a radical Act of Liberation

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,720
freeing us from the reactive patterns

200
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,599
that bind us to our suffering meditation

201
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,560

hear The Whispers of our true selves

208
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,520
guiding us toward insight and

209
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,680
understanding whether it's focusing on

210
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,520
the breath repeating a mantra or

211
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,599
engaging in loving kindness meditation

212

of silence and introspection

214
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,719
away from the clamor of everyday life

through regular meditation we learn to

216
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,240
steady the mind to see beyond the

217
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,000
illusions of the ego and to touch the

218
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,159

practices and our journey towards

241
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,920
Nirvana understanding and practicing the

242
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:52,519
art of Detachment From Desire is

243
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,200
pivotal this step isn't about renouncing

244
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:57,040
the joys and beauty of the world but

245
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,800
about seeing beyond the transient

246
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,040
pleasures and understanding the nature

247
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,519
of craving and attachment desire in its

248
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,839
many forms often leads to suffering not

249
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,959
because of the desire itself but because

250
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,959
of our attachment to the outcomes it

251
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:15,160
demands Detachment From Desire is an

252
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:17,839
invitation to experience life more fully

253
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:21,160
to engage with the world with an open

254
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:24,160
heart without the need for possession or

255
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,920
control it teaches us to appreciate and

256
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,200
love without clinging to experience

257
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,800
without becoming ens snared this freedom

258
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,800
from attachment allows us to move

259
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,720
through life with Grace embracing each

260
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,440
moment as it comes and letting it go as

261
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,760
it

262
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,000
passes the practice begins with

263
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,519
observing our desires without judgment

264
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,959
during our meditation and mindfulness

265
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,320
routines as we become more aware of our

266
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,399
attachments we can gently question their

267
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,880
hold on us do they bring true happiness

268
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,519
or are they a source of unrest with time

269
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,279
and gentle inquiry we can loosen their

270
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,279
grip finding peace peace and contentment

271
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:05,079

272
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:07,120
being Detachment From Desire does not

273
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:10,200
mean Detachment from life on the

274
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,040
contrary it invites us into a richer

free from the shadows of craving and

277
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,360
fear it is in this space of Freedom that

278
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:22,120
the seeds of true happiness can grow

279
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,600

the isolation and separation wrought by

happiness cultivating compassion begins

310
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,480
with turning inward recognizing our

311
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,480

understanding to

313
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,959
ourselves this self-compassion is the

314
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,880
foundation upon which we build our

315
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:50,600
capacity for empathy towards others as

316
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,880
we open our hearts to our pains and

317
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,279
struggles we become more attuned to the

318
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,800
suffering around us and our natural

319
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,880

320
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,639

the worthiness of its recipient

332
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,160
but is a spontaneous overflow of a heart

the surface to recognize the inherent

339
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,199

deeds arise from a place of love and

387
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,759
compassion rather than selfish desire or

388
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,079
ignorance in many spiritual traditions

choices it's about pausing before we act

406
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,360
speak or make decisions asking ourselves

407

generosity over greed or truthfulness

411

413
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,720
responsibility for our actions and their

414
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,319

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,600
interconnectedness of all things and the

461
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,200

and assumptions about the self and the

484
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,280
world it involves a process of

485
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:58,520
