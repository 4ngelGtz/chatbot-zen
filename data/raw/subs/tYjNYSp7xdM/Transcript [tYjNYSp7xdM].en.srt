1
00:00:08,566 --> 00:00:10,066
pause this video right now

2
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm serious hit pause now

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,100
close your eyes and put your hand on your chest

4
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:16,966
feel what's there

5
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:21,100
you feel that that restless energy

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,100
that low grade anxiety humming in the background

7
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,066
that need for something

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,500
anything to make you feel complete

9
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:31,666
that's fire

10
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:34,500
and it's been burning inside you your entire life

11
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:38,600
most of us mistake that burn for drive or stress

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,333
we call it motivation or being human

13
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,366
they're wrong 2,500 years ago

14
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:48,300
a man named Buddha discovered this fire

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,466
burning inside himself

16
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,400
figured out how to extinguish it completely

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,133
and then taught 1,000 other people to do the same thing

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,366
in real time with one speech

19
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:02,433
what's up wisdom seekers

20
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:05,100
Matt here and for the next 20 minutes

21
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,533
I'm going to walk you through that exact speech

22
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,300
not so you can learn about it

23
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,400
but so you can experience it right now on yourself

24
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,166
by the end the fire may still flicker

25
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,400
but it won't run the show ready

26
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:19,133
here's how he pulled it off

27
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:25,100
before we get into Buddha's story

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,133
we need to map your personal fire

29
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:29,033
because his teaching only works

30
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:31,200
if you're honest about what's actually burning

31
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,600
so here's what I want you to do

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,333
as I describe each fire

33
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:37,366
notice if it flares up in your body

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,566
fire No. 1 the craving fire

35
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:43,100
think about your phone right now

36
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:45,333
when was the last time you checked it

37
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:49,200
feel that urge to look that's craving fire

38
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:52,600
it burns every time you want something you don't have

39
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,800
fire No. 2 the rejection fire

40
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:58,200
think about someone who hurt you

41
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:00,200
someone who didn't give you what you deserved

42
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,500
feel that heat rising in your chest

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,200
that's rejection fire it burns every time

44
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,100
reality doesn't match your expectations

45
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:09,400
fire No. 3

46
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,800
the confusion fire

47
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:13,000
think about your future

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,900
all those decisions you need to make

49
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,000
all that uncertainty feel that anxious buzzing

50
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,700
that's confusion fire

51
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,966
it burns every time you don't know what's real

52
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:23,300
or what to do next

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,133
these three fires

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,533
they're what Buddha called the fires of lust

55
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,400
hatred and delusion and they've been burning

56
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,533
inside humans for thousands of years

57
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,533
the question isn't whether you have these fires

58
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,300
you do the question is

59
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:41,400
are you ready to see them clearly

60
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:43,566
because that's exactly what happened

61
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:45,266
on a Hillside in ancient India

62
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,300
when Buddha delivered the most psychologically

63
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,400
devastating speech in human history

64
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:55,466
imagine this

65
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:58,500
you're sitting on a raw Hillside in the Ganges Basin

66
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,466
the air is thick with smoke from dying fire alters

67
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,566
around you sit 1,000 men

68
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:05,000
who've spent their entire lives

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,733
believing that external fire rituals could save them

70
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,366
they weren't stupid

71
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,133
they were the spiritual elite of ancient India

72
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,966
the Kassapa brothers Uruvela

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,800
Nadi and Gaya commanded armies of devoted followers

74
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,566
who genuinely believed their teachers

75
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:21,933
had achieved enlightenment

76
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,566
but here's what's wild they had the exact same fires

77
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:27,300
burning inside them that you do

78
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,500
Uruvela Kassapa burned with spiritual pride

79
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:31,966
his followers burned with

80
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:33,933
the need for approval from their guru

81
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:35,066
with fear

82
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:37,466
that they'd wasted their lives on the wrong path

83
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:40,866
with confusion about what was actually true

84
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:44,233
the only difference between you and those 1000 monks

85
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:44,566
is that

86
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:47,300
they thought external fire rituals would save them

87
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,066
you think external achievements will save you

88
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:52,400
same burning different alters

89
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,400
Buddha looked at this crowd and realized something

90
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:58,800
you can't put out internal fire by worshipping

91
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,200
external fire you can only put it out

92
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,066
by seeing it for what it really is

93
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,800
so he gave them a teaching

94
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,900
that would shatter everything

95
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,500
they believed about themselves

96
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:10,733
starting with the fire they could actually see

97
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,100
Buddha's voice cuts through the Hillside silence

98
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:26,566
he's calm almost clinical

99
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,466
like a doctor naming symptoms

100
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,300
now I want you to imagine he's talking directly to you

101
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,600
because he is

102
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,266
they expected hymns to sacred flame

103
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,600
he turned the spotlight on their nervous systems

104
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:44,566
stop look at your eyes right now

105
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:46,266
how much have you used them today

106
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:49,500
to consume content to compare yourself to others

107
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,133
to search for something that will make you feel better

108
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,033
your eyes aren't just seeing

109
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:55,933
they're burning with the fire of craving

110
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,600
every time you scroll you're feeding the flames

111
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:10,933
Buddha goes deeper it's not just what you see

112
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:13,433
it's how your mind processes what you see

113
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:15,300
the split second when your brain decides

114
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,000
I want that or I hate this or why can't I have that

115
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,500
that's the burning

116
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,700
your tongue

117
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,800
burning with words you wish you could take back

118
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,200
words that came from fire not wisdom

119
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,866
and here's the big one

120
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:38,500
your thoughts themselves are on fire right now

121
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,633
as you're listening to this

122
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:41,400
part of your mind is probably burning

123
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,966
with the need to check your phone

124
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,700
or wondering if this is actually going to help

125
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,866
or judging yourself

126
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:49,066
for having these problems in the first place

127
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,933
that's mind fire

128
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,000
the running commentary the endless wanting

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,400
the never ending story of not enough

130
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,766
Buddha asks

131
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:01,933
and here's where it gets real

132
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,266
check in with your body right now

133
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:21,866
do you feel it

134
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:24,866
that low level burning that never quite goes away

135
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,300
that's not anxiety that's not stress

136
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:30,200
that's not just life

137
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:33,566
that's the fire of constant wanting lust

138
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:37,933
constant rejecting hatred and constant confusion

139
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:41,700
delusion burning through every moment of your existence

140
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:44,666
Buddha is pointing directly at the fire in your chest

141
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,466
right now and saying there

142
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,200
right there that's not life

143
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:52,766
that's suffering

144
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:55,566
and you have the power to see it clearly

145
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,700
but here's the key that those 1,000 monks discovered

146
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,633
seeing thus the instructed

147
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:12,066
noble disciple grows disenchanted with the burning

148
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:13,833
becomes dispassionate toward it

149
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,933
and through dispassion finds freedom

150
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,733
you don't fight the fire you don't feed the fire

151
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,333
you simply see it for what it is

152
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:26,800
become disinterested in it and watch it burn itself out

153
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,000
according to the Pali Canon

154
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:34,533
here's what happened next

155
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,866
but let me tell you what this actually felt like

156
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,266
imagine you've been carrying a 100 pound backpack

157
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:50,733
your entire life

158
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:53,166
you've gotten so used to the weight

159
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,733
that you forgot it was there

160
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,066
and then suddenly someone points to it and says

161
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:01,066
you can set that down now

162
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:06,200
that's what happened on that Hillside

163
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,900
one monk later described it as

164
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,966
the moment he realized

165
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:11,366
he didn't have to be afraid of his own thoughts anymore

166
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:14,366
another said it felt like waking up from a nightmare

167
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:15,800
he didn't know he was having

168
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,733
they weren't fighting their minds

169
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:19,600
they weren't suppressing their desires

170
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,400
they simply saw the burning clearly

171
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:24,366
and stopped being burned by it

172
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:26,366
the fire was still there

173
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,066
but it lost its power to consume them

174
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:34,300
now here's what I want you to do right now pause

175
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:35,766
notice the heat in the chest

176
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:36,933
the pull in the gut

177
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,466
feel that burning in your chest again

178
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:40,300
but this time

179
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,533
instead of trying to fix it or get rid of it

180
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:46,266
just see it see how it wants your attention

181
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:47,500
see how it promises

182
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,600
that if you just scroll one more time

183
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,100
buy one more thing achieve one more goal

184
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,466
it will finally be satisfied

185
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,333
see how it lies the fire doesn't want satisfaction

186
00:09:00,766 --> 00:09:03,666
it wants fuel and every time you feed it

187
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,833
it gets stronger but when you see it clearly

188
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,766
when you become genuinely disinterested in its promises

189
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:13,533
something shifts the fire is still burning

190
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:15,700
but you're not burning with it

191
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,566
that's your fire sermon moment right here right now

192
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,366
those 1,000 monks didn't just have a nice

193
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,866
spiritual experience and go back to their old lives

194
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,566
they developed a practice

195
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:33,666
a way to see fire clearly every single day

196
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,866
here's how you do it

197
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,400
step 1 name the fire

198
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:40,266
when that burning starts in your chest

199
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:42,600
don't distract yourself don't feed it

200
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,200
name it craving fire

201
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,266
rejection fire

202
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,266
confusion fire

203
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,200
step 2 feel where it burns

204
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,033
where exactly do you feel it

205
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,000
in your body chest

206
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,900
throat stomach

207
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,600
just notice

208
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,933
don't try to change it

209
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:06,766
step 3 see what it wants

210
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,200
what is this fire trying to get you to do

211
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:11,700
check your phone buy something

212
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:14,766
start an argument get someone's approval

213
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,933
see the wanting clearly

214
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:21,600
step 4 become dispassionate

215
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:24,366
this is the key you don't fight the fire

216
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,100
you don't feed it you

217
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,900
become genuinely uninterested in what it's promising

218
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,666
like watching a movie you've seen a thousand times

219
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,733
step 5 watch it burn out without fuel

220
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:40,500
fire dies when you stop feeding craving

221
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,233
it fades when you stop feeding rejection

222
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:46,400
it dissolves when you stop feeding confusion

223
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,600
clarity appears

224
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,866
this isn't theory this is the exact method Buddha used

225
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:56,366
the same one that liberated 1000 people simultaneously

226
00:10:56,666 --> 00:11:00,300
and it works right now on you

227
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:06,966
most people think Buddha's fire

228
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,066
sermon was his final word on liberation

229
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:12,566
it wasn't after this mass awakening

230
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:15,400
Buddha gave those 1,000 monks a follow up teaching

231
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,033
that completely flipped everything

232
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:18,966
they thought they knew about enlightenment

233
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:22,600
he taught them that even clinging to the one who sees

234
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,500
clearly is a subtle burn

235
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,133
that even clinging to enlightenment must be abandoned

236
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:30,066
that the deepest freedom comes

237
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:32,100
when you realize there was never anyone there

238
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,700
to be burned in the first place

239
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:35,700
the follow up teaching

240
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,866
that made even these newly enlightened monks

241
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:38,866
question everything

242
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,066
they thought they knew about freedom itself

243
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,600
later traditions

244
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,233
built whole schools on the implications

245
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:48,666
of what came next and that is a story for another night

246
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,066
but right now you have everything you need

247
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:55,700
the fire is visible the method is clear

248
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
the only question is

249
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,433
whether you're ready to stop being consumed by flames

250
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:01,166
that exist only in your mind

251
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,900
notice any shift you just experienced

252
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,600
the same teaching that transformed 1,000 people

253
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,866
2,500 years ago

254
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,866
if this shifted something in you

255
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,966
subscribe and turn on notifications

256
00:12:16,966 --> 00:12:19,600
we're diving deep into practices that actually change

257
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,700
your life not just your thoughts

258
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:23,466
comment below with one word

259
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:25,500
describing the fire that burns strongest in you

260
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,333
right now let's see it clearly together

261
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,700
and if you wanna know

262
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,966
what Buddha's most radical teaching was

263
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,700
the one that makes even enlightenment look like another

264
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,166
trap that's up next

265
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:39,400
until then remember

266
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,466
you're burning but you don't have to be consumed

267
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,966
the fire has no power over you once you see it clearly

268
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,000
peace
