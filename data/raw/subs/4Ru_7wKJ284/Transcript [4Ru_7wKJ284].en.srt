1
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:10,033
right now you're probably holding on to the belief

2
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:12,066
this video will change something for you

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,500
maybe fix that thing you've been wrestling with

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,900
maybe give you the answer you've been hunting for

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,400
and that hope

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,933
that exact feeling you're experiencing right now

7
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:23,466
Buddha called it the invisible chain

8
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:27,700
I know it sounds completely backwards

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,966
we're told hope is good hope is what keeps us going

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,966
hope is what separates us from well

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,400
people who've given up

12
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:37,866
but here's what nobody talks about

13
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:40,800
while you've been hoping for your life to start

14
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:43,900
your actual life has been happening

15
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:46,066
and you've been missing it

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Buddha saw this trap 2,500 years ago

17
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:55,666
he called it tanha the thirst that's never satisfied

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,666
we call it motivation same prison

19
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:00,133
different marketing

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,300
listen I spent years living like this

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,900
always hoping for the next thing

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,266
to make everything click

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,866
the job that finally feels right

24
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:11,200
the relationship where I finally feel whole

25
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:14,400
the version of myself I can finally stand to be around

26
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,933
and you know what I realized I wasn't living

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,866
I was rehearsing to live there's a profound difference

28
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,033
so if you're ready to stop asking permission

29
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:25,600
to start your actual life

30
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,600
stick around because what I'm about to show you

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,766
is going to mess with everything

32
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:31,400
you think you know about hope

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,766
and yeah this might sting

34
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:43,533
hope feels like you're doing something

35
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,100
like you're moving forward

36
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,600
like you're getting somewhere

37
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,233
but hope is the candy coated delay button

38
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:51,700
you keep pressing it thinking you're making progress

39
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,266
but all you're doing is avoiding

40
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:55,966
right now I see this everywhere

41
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:57,833
people scrolling through job listings

42
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,533
they're never going to apply to

43
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:01,233
hoping their ex will text back

44
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:03,200
so they don't have to actually move on

45
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:05,800
waiting for Monday to start that diet

46
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,833
Tuesday to have that conversation next month

47
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,466
to finally make the change

48
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,200
hope becomes this beautiful excuse

49
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,900
for not engaging with what's actually

50
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,266
happening in your life

51
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:18,800
you tell yourself you're being optimistic

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,100
you're being positive you're keeping the vision alive

53
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:23,733
really

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,900
you're procrastinating with good marketing

55
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,700
because here's the thing about hope

56
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,333
it always lives tomorrow

57
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:32,000
never today

58
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:36,133
hope promises you that happiness is coming eventually

59
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:40,066
that peace is on its way soon

60
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:43,933
that your real life will start later

61
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:47,466
and while you're busy hoping for tomorrow to save you

62
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:48,800
today disappears

63
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:52,166
then another today then another

64
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:57,466
hope feels like motion but it's emotional quicksand

65
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,400
you're not moving toward anything

66
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,933
you're stuck in the waiting room of your own life

67
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:04,400
believing someone will call your name

68
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:11,266
Buddha didn't say dream big

69
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:12,566
he said let go

70
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,966
because every hope you have is attachment in disguise

71
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:18,666
and attachment is the root of suffering

72
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,100
now I know this sounds harsh

73
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,133
we live in a culture that worships hope

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,200
vision boards manifestation

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,600
positive thinking it's all craving with better branding

76
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:30,533
but Buddha saw through it

77
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,466
in the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta

78
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:33,400
he taught

79
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:38,866
and when we cling to that craving

80
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:41,333
that's when suffering takes root

81
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:44,400
the Buddha didn't say suffering comes from failure

82
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,066
he said it comes from craving

83
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,866
that's the second noble truth

84
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:50,266
and hope

85
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
it's craving with better PR

86
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,866
think about it when you hope for something

87
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:57,233
you're essentially saying

88
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:58,833
I'm not okay right now

89
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,766
but I will be when this thing happens

90
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,066
that's the trap it's not the wanting that destroys us

91
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:07,566
it's never being okay without the thing we want

92
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:09,633
whether it's swiping on dating apps

93
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,000
chasing startup dreams

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,366
or meditating to feel enlightened enough

95
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,900
it's all the same fuel craving dressed as vision

96
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,166
here's what Buddha actually taught

97
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,600
even he had a goal awakening

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,433
but he wasn't miserable while working toward it

99
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,133
he wasn't broken without it

100
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:28,466
the difference

101
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,000
he wasn't hoping for enlightenment to fix him

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,366
he was already walking the path with presence

103
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,600
not desperation

104
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,800
I've been all three types of hope addicts

105
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,833
the entrepreneur with the vision board

106
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,733
the guy chasing the perfect partner

107
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:48,233
the meditation junkie

108
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:50,733
who secretly wanted to be enlightened and admired

109
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:53,966
I hoped so hard I practically dislocated my soul

110
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,400
the dating apps were the worst

111
00:04:56,433 --> 00:05:00,166
three years of swiping hoping to find the one

112
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:04,466
know what happened I became an expert at disappointment

113
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,700
because every swipe right was hope

114
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:09,333
and every match that didn't work out was suffering

115
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:12,066
the pattern was brutal hope

116
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:14,366
excitement disappointment

117
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,533
repeat

118
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:19,733
until I realized I wasn't looking for love

119
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,133
I was hoping love would fix the emptiness I felt alone

120
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:27,500
same with meditation I'd sit there not seeking peace

121
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,400
but hoping people would see how spiritual I was

122
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,166
I was treating Buddhism like a personality upgrade

123
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:36,466
and you know what all that hoping got me

124
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:39,800
a really sophisticated way to avoid my actual life

125
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:43,000
when you're addicted to hope

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,666
the present moment becomes this inconvenient obstacle

127
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,766
between you and your imagined future

128
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,500
you're not really here

129
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,366
you're mentally rehearsing next week

130
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:54,533
planning next month fantasizing about next year

131
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:56,766
your body is sitting at your desk

132
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:58,433
but your mind is already at the beach house

133
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:00,500
you're going to buy when you finally make it

134
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:02,966
your partner is trying to connect

135
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:04,866
but you're stuck wishing they'd change

136
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:06,600
your kids need your presence

137
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,666
but you're too busy

138
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,900
hoping you'll become the parent they deserve later

139
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:14,233
hope made a lot of promises

140
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:16,700
but it never paid rent in my actual life

141
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:22,066
the worst part hope addiction feels productive

142
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:24,500
it feels like you're working on yourself

143
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,900
like you're being proactive

144
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:29,466
really you're avoiding

145
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:31,600
the one thing that could actually change everything

146
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,300
right now like drinking salt water

147
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,600
the more you gulp the thirstier you get

148
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,733
the real magic happens when you stop waiting

149
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
stop needing

150
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,866
stop requiring tomorrow to be different than today

151
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,766
when you finally show up right here

152
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:55,266
right now without needing anything to change

153
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:57,700
that's where life actually exists

154
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,866
the Bhaddekaratta Sutta puts it perfectly

155
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,766
present moment awareness without future projection

156
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:18,866
action without attachment to results

157
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,166
peace that doesn't depend on circumstances improving

158
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:24,000
now hold on

159
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,966
I'm not saying give up on your dreams

160
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,033
I'm not saying

161
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,666
become some Zen robot who doesn't care about anything

162
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,600
that's not freedom that's depression with better PR

163
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:35,100
there's a profound

164
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,966
difference between having a direction

165
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:38,933
and being addicted to the destination

166
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:41,433
this isn't about giving up direction

167
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,533
it's about dropping the desperation

168
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:46,466
Buddhists call it right intention

169
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,766
action that comes from clarity

170
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:50,533
not craving

171
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:53,133
here's the weird thing I noticed

172
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:54,833
the best things in my life

173
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,700
showed up when I stopped chasing them

174
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,066
the job opportunities

175
00:07:58,066 --> 00:08:00,333
came when I was focused on doing good work

176
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,966
not hunting for escape

177
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:05,533
the relationship happened when I was genuinely happy

178
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,000
alone not desperately swiping

179
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,666
it's like the universe has this twisted sense of humor

180
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,533
when you're grabbing for something

181
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:15,166
it slips away

182
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
when you're present with what you're doing

183
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,366
doors open

184
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,100
hope can guide you

185
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,200
don't let Hope's leash drag you around

186
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,433
the shift is internal

187
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:28,633
are you creating from excitement or from terror

188
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,366
that you're not enough

189
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:30,966
without the thing you're hoping for

190
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,866
when you stop outsourcing your peace to tomorrow

191
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:36,300
you don't lose motivation

192
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,733
you find the only motivation that actually works

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,733
the kind that doesn't collapse when things get hard

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,200
and yeah this is terrifying

195
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:47,966
because if you're not hoping for tomorrow to save you

196
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,666
then you have to deal with today

197
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:51,766
all of it the good

198
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,200
the messy the incomplete

199
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:57,400
but here's what Buddha figured out

200
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,300
he wasn't selling comfort

201
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:02,800
he was offering escape not from the world

202
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,000
but from needing it to be different

203
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:12,400
quitting hope feels like quitting caffeine

204
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:15,166
at first you're a mess

205
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:17,700
you feel purposeless lost

206
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,700
like what's the point of doing anything

207
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,900
if you're not hoping it leads somewhere better

208
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,333
but then you get clear

209
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,200
you stop outsourcing your peace to a maybe

210
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,166
you start acting from what is

211
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,766
not what you wish were true

212
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,666
you can still want things

213
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,600
you can still dream plan

214
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,200
work toward goals

215
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,566
the shift happens inside

216
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:42,533
Buddha taught that everything is impermanent anicca

217
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,966
but hope tries to freeze the future

218
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:47,666
into something solid and that illusion

219
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:50,333
it's what keeps us chasing instead of living

220
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:53,166
skillful intention versus craving

221
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,800
creating from presence versus creating from desperation

222
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:58,700
you're not waiting anymore

223
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,500
you're not running on fumes from tomorrow anymore

224
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:04,766
you're doing and the crazy thing

225
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:07,233
when you stop needing the future to fix you

226
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:09,900
you actually start building a future worth having

227
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:12,466
from the Dhammapada

228
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:22,900
you don't need a better day to begin

229
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:25,966
you need today's honesty and presence

230
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:33,700
Buddha never promised things would go your way

231
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
he promised you could be free even when they don't

232
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:42,566
so for the next 24 hours catch yourself hoping

233
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,133
notice it and ask yourself

234
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,466
what would I do if I wasn't waiting anymore

235
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:50,200
what would you create

236
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,900
if you weren't hoping for permission

237
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:52,966
what would you say

238
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:54,966
if you weren't hoping for the perfect moment

239
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,633
who would you become if you stopped waiting

240
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:58,933
to be someone else

241
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,200
let go of hope

242
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,666
and in the silence that follows

243
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,466
you might find something better clarity

244
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,666
courage presence

245
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,966
the breakthrough wasn't a shiny new future

246
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:14,133
it was finally being done chasing one

247
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:17,800
in the fire sermon Buddha taught

248
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:25,200
he was talking about how our senses burn with craving

249
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,333
with desire with becoming and hope

250
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,733
it's the flame we feed thinking it'll keep us warm

251
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:33,366
but it leaves us restless

252
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,366
Buddha sat under that Bodhi tree

253
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:39,100
not hoping for enlightenment

254
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,233
but finally done

255
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,233
with the exhausting game of waiting for tomorrow

256
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,600
to save him that moment

257
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,066
when he stopped hoping to become someone else

258
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,300
that's when he became the Buddha

259
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,633
in the legends when Mara challenged the Buddha

260
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:56,266
he didn't fight back he simply touched the earth

261
00:11:56,566 --> 00:12:00,400
that was the moment he wasn't reaching for the future

262
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:02,466
he was rooting in what is

263
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:04,866
that's the gesture of freedom

264
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:08,566
this video won't save you

265
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:11,566
and that's the point because you were never stuck

266
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,200
you were hoping for someone else

267
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,266
to do what only you can stop hoping start living

268
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,866
if this shattered something in you

269
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,233
don't wait for others to find it

270
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:25,866
share it and tell me in the comments

271
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,266
what are you ready to stop waiting for
