date in the poly Canon the earliest

32
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,000
record of the Buddha's teachings there's

33
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,520
a story that perfectly captures the

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,119
essence of mindful listening the Buddha

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,640
is approached by a young man named utara

36
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,560
who is seeking guidance

37
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,119
instead of launching into a lecture the

38
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,720
Buddha simply says I am ready to listen

39
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,040
he gives utara his complete undivided

40
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,520
attention creating a space for the young

41
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,159
man to share his struggles and

42
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,479
concerns this story reveals a profound

43
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,560
truth the greatest gift we can give

44
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,920
another person is our full uninterrupted

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,840
presence in a world where distractions

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,119
are constant and attention is fragmented

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,759
the simple Act of listening deeply has

48
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,600
become a rare and precious commodity

49
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,399
it's like the diamond of interpersonal

50
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:12,840
skills rare valuable and oh so

51
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,200
sparkly think about your own life how

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,560
often do you find yourself half

53
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,239
listening to someone while scrolling

54
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,920
through your phone or planning your

55
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,400
response before they've even finished

56
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,000
speaking we've all been guilty of it

57
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,440
myself included but when we listen in

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,720
this way we send a subtle but powerful

59
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,599
message you're not important enough for

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,560
my full attention

61
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,400
and that my friends is about as

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,080
attractive as a durian fruit

63
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,959
smoothie now contrast that with how you

64
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,239
feel when someone really listens to you

65
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,280
when they put away their devices look

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,599
you in the eye and give you their

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,680
complete

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,879
Focus it's a remarkable feeling isn't it

69
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,400
you feel valued understood

70
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:56,440
connected That's The Power of mindful

71
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,440
listening suddenly you're not just

72
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,280
another face in the crowd you're the

73
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,879
most fascinating person in in the room

74
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,400
so how can we cultivate this

75
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,799
irresistible habit the Buddha outlined

76
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,480
four key elements of mindful listening

77
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,519
known in Sanskrit as the Katara or four

78
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,480
ears and no it's not some kind of weird

79
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:20,319
Buddha mutant power although that would

80
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,480
be pretty cool sh inali listening with

81
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,519
our physical ears being fully present

82
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,799
and attentive to the words being

83
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,879
spoken this means setting aside

84
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,959
distractions focusing on the person in

85
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,720
front of us and TR hearing what they're

86
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,920
saying when we listen with all four ears

87
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,000
we create a profound sense of connection

88
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,120
and

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,480
understanding it's about being in the

90
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,640
moment not letting our minds wander to

91
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,920
other tasks or concerns so put down that

92
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,360
phone stop mentally planning your

93
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,760
grocery list and tune in to the person

94
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,360
in front of you two saitta listening

95
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,720
with our mind free from judgment

96
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,799
preconceptions or planning our

97
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,280
response this is perhaps the most

98
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,480
challenging aspect of mindful listening

99
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,519
our minds are always active always

100
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,879
interpreting and evaluating what we hear

101
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,680
but to listen mindfully we need to quiet

102
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,319
that inner chatter and open ourselves up

103
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,759
to the other person's perspective this

104
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,759
doesn't mean we have to agree with

105
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:20,519
everything they say but we do need to

106
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,759
create a mental space for their thoughts

107
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,080
and feelings to be expressed without

108
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:31,039
interference think of it as a mental do

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:32,960
not disturb sign three Vena Vena inl

110
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,520
listening with our discernment seeking

111
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,960
to truly understand the speaker's

112
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,160
perspective and experience this goes

113
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,199
beyond just hearing the words it's about

114
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,680
reading between the lines picking up on

115
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,840
non-verbal cues and empathizing with the

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,320
other person's

117
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,560
situation it's about asking clarifying

118
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,960
questions when needed reflecting back

119
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,360
what we've heard to ensure understanding

120
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,280
and seeking to see the world through

121
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,199
their eyes in other words it's like

122
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,600
putting on a pair of empathy

123
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:04,199
goggles four

124
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,400
prna paana in Pali listening with our

125
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,280
wisdom considering how we can respond

126
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,120
with compassion and skillful action this

127
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,039
is where mindful listening transforms

128
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,440
from a passive act to an active one

129
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:17,479
having truly heard and understood the

130
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,360
other person we now have the opportunity

131
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:23,039
to offer support guidance or simply our

132
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,639
heartfelt presence but this response

133
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,880
arises from a place of wisdom and

134
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,720
compassion not from a place of judgment

135
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,400
or agenda it's about being a wise and

136
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,759
loving presence not a know-it-all or a

137
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,520
fixer when we listen with all four ears

138
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,039
we create a profound sense of connection

139
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,479
and understanding we make the other

140
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,120
person feel truly seen and heard which

141
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,199
is one of the greatest gifts we can

142
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,440
offer and let's be real who doesn't want

143
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,600
to unwrap the gift of being truly

144
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,360
understood but mindful listening isn't

145
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,319
just about platonic relationships it can

146
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,000
also be a powerful tool for increasing

147
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,720
your romantic and sexual attractiveness

148
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,880
when you give your full undivided

149
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,759
attention to a potential partner you're

150
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,039
communicating that they are important

151
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,360
interesting and

152
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,360
desirable you're creating an intimate

153
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,280
space where they feel safe to open up

154
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,440
and be vulnerable and vulnerability as

155
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,039
we all know is the secret sauce of deep

156
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,759
connection moreover mindful listening

157
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,639
can help you tune into the subtle cues

158
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,000
and signals that indicate romantic

159
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,120
interest by being fully present and

160
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,479
attuned to the other person you're more

161
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,800
likely to pick up on flirtatious glances

162
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:36,960
changes in body language or shifts in

163
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,479
tone of voice this heightened awareness

164
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,639

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,960
responsive partner increasing your

166
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:47,599
irresistibility Factor basically you

connection and understanding the

170
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,800
foundation of any strong romantic

171
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,000
relationship when you truly see and

172
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,199
appreciate someone for who they are not

173
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,199
just for their superficial qualities

174
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,680
you create the potential for a profound

175
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,879
and Lasting

176
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,840
bond this depth of connection is

177
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,440
ultimately far more attractive than any

178
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,080
pickup line or physical feature it's the

179
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,680
difference between a cheap flashy

180
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,720
trinket and a precious enduring Gem of

181
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,879
course it's important to note that

182
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,879
mindful listening isn't about

183
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,599
manipulation or trying to make someone

184
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:25,720
fall for you it's about being genuinely

185
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:27,280
interested present and compassionate

186
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,039
qualities that are naturally attractive

187
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,440
to others as the Buddha said

188
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,680
aaso come and see for

189
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,639
