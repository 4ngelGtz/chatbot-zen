a long time ago in a galaxy far far away

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,880
a little green Jedi Master taught us

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,000

39
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,920
same way again

fellow padawans let's Dive Right Into

42
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,640
the Heart of today's topic with a

43
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,640
thought-provoking question what do you

44
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,820
think Yoda would say about the nature of

45
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,560
suffering take a moment to ponder

46
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,400
[Music]

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,120
this in the Star Wars Universe we see

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,440
Yoda as a wise and powerful Jedi Master

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,000
but have you ever considered how his

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,280
teachings might relate to the Buddhist

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,599
concept of Dua or suffering

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,599
picture this scene from The Empire

53
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,680
Strikes Back Luke Skywalker our eager

54
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:39,239
young hero is struggling to master the

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,680
ways of the force he's frustrated

56
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,560
impatient and riddled with self-doubt

57
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,879
sound familiar we've all been there

58
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,319
right that's when Yoda drops this

59
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,879
bombshell fear is the path to the dark

60
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:55,360
side fear leads to anger anger leads to

61
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,360
hate hate leads to

62
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,239
suffering mind blown right but wait

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,959
there's more

64
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,879
this simple yet profound statement

65
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,360
encapsulates a fundamental Buddhist

66
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,080
teaching the four noble truths the first

67
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,080
Noble Truth states that life is

68
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,640
suffering or Dua but what does this

69
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,519
really mean suffering in the Buddhist

70
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,959
sense doesn't just refer to physical

71
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,239
pain or emotional anguish it's the

72
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,440
persistent feeling that something is off

73
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,720
or unsatisfactory in our lives it's the

74
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,200
nagging sense that we're not quite whole

75
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,720
or content even when things seem to be

76
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,640
going well and that's precisely what

77
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,040
Yoda is pointing out to

78
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,239
Luke by giving in to his fears and

79
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,959
negative emotions Luke is creating his

80
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,120
own suffering he's allowing his mind to

81
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,560
be consumed by anger hatred and doubt

82
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,280
which only leads him further away from

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,040
the peace and balance he seeks but

84
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,239
here's the kicker Yoda doesn't just

85
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,959
leave us hanging with this harsh reality

86
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,560
check like any good Buddhist teacher he

87
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,680
offers a path forward and that my friend

88
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,959
is where the real adventure begins so as

89
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,400
we continue our journey through the

90
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:11,159
wisdom of Yoda and Buddhism keep this

91
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,360
question in mind how can we like Luke

92
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,990
learn to recognize and overcome the root

93
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,040
causes of our

94
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,400
[Music]

95
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,639
suffering get ready to uncover some

96
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,040
mindblowing insights that will forever

97
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,639
change the way you view your own

98
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,639
struggles and

99
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:34,600
challenges much to learn you still

100
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,919
have now let's take a closer look at the

101
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,560
enigmatic figure of Yoda and explore how

102
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:39,720
his character embodies the essence of

103
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,479
Buddhist

104
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,160
teachings when we first meet Yoda in The

105
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,960
Empire Strikes Back he appears as a

106
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:51,520
peculiar mischievous creature living in

107
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:55,080
the swamps of dagaba Luke our impatient

108
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,199
hero dismisses him as a mere annoyance

109
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,639
failing to recognize the profound wisdom

110
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,639
beneath the surface

111
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,080
how often do we Overlook the greatest

112
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,919
life lessons because they come in

113
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,039
unexpected packages but as the story

114
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:11,400
unfolds we discover that Yoda is not

115
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,080
only a Jedi master but also a being who

116
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,240
has transcended the limitations of the

117
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,600
material world he possesses a deep

118
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,720
understanding of the force which in many

119
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,199
ways parallels the Buddhist concept of

120
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,280
interconnectedness in Buddhism the idea

121
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,639
of interconnectedness suggests that all

122
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,720
living beings are intricately linked and

123
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,639
that our actions have far-reaching

124
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,199
consequences similarly Yoda teaches that

125
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,800
the force binds all things together and

126
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,759
that by tapping into this Universal

127
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,919
energy we can achieve great wisdom and

128
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:46,680
power but here's the fascinating part

129
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,520
George Lucas the creator of Star Wars

130
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,759
has openly acknowledged the influence of

131
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,280
Buddhism on his work in fact he has

132
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,240
stated that Yoda's character was

133
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,840
inspired by the Buddhist concept of the

134
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,880
Bodhi satva an enlightened being who

135
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,199
postpones their own Nirvana to help

136
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,800
others achieve

137
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,400
Liberation think about it Yoda like a

138
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,000
bodhisatwa dedicates his life to guiding

139
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,840
and teaching others even in the face of

140
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,840
great adversity he embodies the Buddhist

141
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,919
virtues of compassion wisdom and

142
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,360
selflessness always putting the needs of

143
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,520
others before his

144
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,680
own throughout the Star Wars saga we see

145
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,560
Yoda imparting his knowledge to various

146
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,199
characters from Luke Skywalker to Count

147
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,680
Dooku he teaches them to let go of their

148
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,160
attachments to find balance within

149
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,360
themselves and to cultivate a deep

150
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,000
understanding of the

151
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,199
force these teachings closely mirror the

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,720
Buddhist path to Enlightenment which

153
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,599
emphasizes the importance of

154
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,919
non-attachment mindfulness and inner

155
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:49,599
peace but Yoda's connection to Buddhism

156
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,360
goes beyond mere philosophical

157
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,840
similarities even his physical

158
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,880
appearance seems to draw inspiration

159
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:58,080
from Buddhist iconography with his

160
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,680
wrinkled skin elongated ears and small

161
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,280
stature Yoda a striking resemblance to

162
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,639
the Buddhist deity budha often depicted

163
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,800
as a jolly bald monk with a large belly

164
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,479
and a smile on his face of course we

165
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,840
can't say for certain that George Lucas

166
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,160
intentionally modeled Yoda after budha

167
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,919
but the parallels are hard to ignore

168
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,479
it's as if Yoda embodies the very

169
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,680
essence of Buddhist wisdom reminding us

170
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:24,000
that true power lies not in physical

171
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,400
strength but in the cultivation of a

172
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
peaceful Compassionate

173
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,120
Heart so the next time you watch Yoda on

174
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,240
screen pay attention to the depth of his

175
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,879
teachings and the way he embodies the

176
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,160
core principles of Buddhism you might

177
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:42,560
just find yourself saying luminous

178
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,840
beings are we not this crude

179
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,360
matter and realizing that the path to

180
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,360
Enlightenment is closer than you ever

181
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:57,680
imagined

182
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,680
do or do not there is no try

183
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:06,560
in The Empire Strikes Back Yoda famously

184
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:08,080
tells Luke do or do not there is no try

185
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,560
at first glance this might seem like

186
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,599
nothing more than a catchy oneliner but

187
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,840
when we dig deeper we discover a

188
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:18,000
profound lesson about the power of

189
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,240
mindfulness you see when Yoda says there

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,720
is no try he's not suggesting that we

191
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,440
shouldn't make an effort instead he's

192
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,840
encouraging us to be fully present and

193
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,240
committed to the task at hand he's

194
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,759
urging us to let go of our doubts fears

195
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,240
and distractions and to focus our minds

196
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,440
on the present

197
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,680
moment this is the essence of

198
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,399
mindfulness the practice of bringing our

199
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,159
attention to the here and now without

200
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,200
judgment or distraction and it's a

201
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,000
concept that lies at the very heart of

202
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,800
Buddhist

203
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,320
Meditation in Buddhism mindfulness is

204
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,920
often described as the path to

205
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,240
Liberation from

206
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,760
suffering by learning to observe our

207
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,880
thoughts and emotions without getting

208
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,320
caught up in them we can begin to break

209
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,040
free from the cycle of reactivity and

210
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,240
distress that so often plagues Our Lives

211
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,760
think about it how many times have you

212
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,720
found yourself stuck in a loop of

213
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,440
negative thoughts replaying past regrets

214
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,240
or worrying about future

215
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,279
uncertainties when we're trapped in

216
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,880
these patterns it's easy to feel like

217
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,959
we're struggling against an invisible

218
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,240
force much like Luke trying to raise his

219
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,200
X-Wing from the

220
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,440
swamp but as Yoda teaches the key to

221
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,760
overcoming these challenges lies not in

222
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,680
some external power but in the strength

223
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,000
of our own minds by cultivating

224
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,680
mindfulness we can learn to observe our

225
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,959
thoughts and emotions with Clarity and

226
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,000
equinity allowing us to respond to

227
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,680
Life's challenges with greater wisdom

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,399
and

229
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,160
resilience so how can we apply this

230
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,560
lesson to our own lives one simple way

231
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,959
is to start a daily meditation

232
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,480
practice even just a few minutes of

233
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,800
sitting quietly and focusing on your

234
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,920
breath can help to calm your mind and

235
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,839
bring you into the present moment

236
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,240
another way is to practice mindfulness

237
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,079
in your daily activities whether you're

238
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,399
washing dishes walking to work or having

239
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,720
a conversation with a friend try to

240
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,800
bring your full attention to the task at

241
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,800
hand notice the sensations thoughts and

242
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,440
emotions that arise without getting

243
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,880
caught up in them as you begin to

244
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,600
cultivate mindfulness you may find that

245
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,279
life's challenges start to lose their

246
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,560
grip on you you may discover a greater

247
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,200
sense of Peace clarity and resilience

248
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,720
even in the face of adversity so if you

249
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,800
find yourself struggling with a

250
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,920
difficult task or emotion remember

251
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,480
Yoda's wise words do or do not there is

252
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,680
no

253
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,200
try embrace the power of mindfulness and

254
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,240
Trust in the strength of your own mind

255
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,000
to guide you

256
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:56,480
[Music]

257
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,680
through fear is the path to the dark

258
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,880
side let's dive deeper into another

259
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,000
crucial lesson from Yoda and Buddhism

260
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,600
the importance of overcoming fear and

261
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,920
attachment in the Star Wars Universe we

262
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,519
see the destructive power of fear play

263
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,440
out time and time again from Anakin

264
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,000
Skywalker's descent into darkness to

265
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,639
Luke's struggle with the Temptation Of

266
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,480
the Dark Side fear is often portrayed as

267
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:24,480
the Ultimate Enemy of the Jedi and it's

268
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,680
no wonder why as Yoda wisely

269
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:32,639
observes fear is the path to the dark

270
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:36,440
side fear leads to anger anger leads to

271
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:38,760
hate hate leads to

272
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,360
suffering this powerful statement Echoes

273
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,200
a fundamental Buddhist teaching about

274
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,000
the root causes of our

275
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,440
distress in Buddhism fear and attachment

276
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,200
are seen as two of the greatest

277
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,279
obstacles to Inner Peace and

278
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,920
Enlightenment when we're consumed by

279
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:55,240
fear whether it's fear of loss failure

280
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,440
or the unknown we become trapped in a

281
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,880
cycle of anxiety and suffering we cling

282
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,720
to the illusion of control desperately

283
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,639
trying to hold on to the things we love

284
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,600
and push away the things we don't but as

285
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:11,079
Yoda and the Buddha both teach this kind

286
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,519
of attachment only leads to more

287
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:15,839
suffering the more we try to grasp and

288
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,839
cling the more we set ourselves up for

289
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,160
disappointment and pain true Freedom

290
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,000
comes from letting go from learning to

291
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,600
accept the impermanence of all things

292
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,760
and finding peace in the present moment

293
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,240
think of Luke in The Empire Strikes Back

294
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,399
when he has a vision of his friends in

295
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,920
danger driven by fear and attachment he

296
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,440
rushes off to save them ignoring Yoda's

297
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,839
warnings about the dangers of leaving

298
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,199
his training in complete as a result he

299
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,480
nearly loses his life and sets himself

300
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:47,639
back on his path to becoming a

301
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,120
Jedi it's a powerful reminder that fear

302
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,360
and attachment can Cloud our judgment

303
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,920
and lead us astray even when our

304
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:59,800
intentions are good so how can we learn

305
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,399
to overcome these destructive emotions

306
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,480
one key teaching from both Yoda and

307
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,360
Buddhism is the practice of

308
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,920
non-attachment this doesn't mean that we

309
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,600
shouldn't care about the people and

310
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,760
things in our lives rather it means

311
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,440
learning to love and appreciate them

312
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,160
without clinging or trying to control

313
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,519
the

314
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,800
outcome it means recognizing that change

315
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,279
is a natural part of life and that

316
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,720
everything from our possessions to our

317
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,959
relationships to our own bodies is

318
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,720
impermanent by learning to let go of our

319
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,920
attachments and embrace the present

320
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,399
moment

321
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,120
we can find a deeper sense of Peace and

322
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,639
Freedom another important lesson is the

323
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:42,000
power of facing our fears head on as

324
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:46,240
Yoda tells Luke named must be your fear

325
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,160
before banish it you can in other words

326
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,759
we can't overcome our fears by running

327
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,800
away from them or pretending they don't

328
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:56,360
exist we have to confront them directly

329
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,079
with courage and compassion this might

330
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,360
mean having a difficult conversation

331
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,639
with a loved one taking a risk in our

332
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,560
career or simply sitting with our own

333
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,680
discomfort and anxiety by learning to

334
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,360
face our fears with an open heart and a

335
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,320
willing Spirit we can begin to break

336
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,160
free from their grip and live with

337
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,519
greater ease and

338
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,040
authenticity so the next time you find

339
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,040
yourself caught in the clutches of fear

340
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,720
or attachment remember the wise words of

341
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,440
Yoda train yourself to let go of

342
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,639
everything you fear to

343
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,440
lose embrace the power of non-attachment

344
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,300
and Trust in your own inner strength to

345
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,519
guide you

346
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:39,920
[Music]

347
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:39,920
through you must unlearn what you have

348
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:46,360
learn in Return of the Jedi Yoda imparts

349
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,279
a powerful message to Luke just before

350
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,720
he passes away he says when gone am I

351
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:55,920
the last of the Jedi will you be the

352
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,959
force runs strong in your family pass on

353
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,880
what you have

354
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:02,199
learned at first glance this might seem

355
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,240
like a simple passing of the torch but

356
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:06,199
when we look deeper we discover a

357
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,800
profound lesson about letting go of

358
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:11,240
control you see throughout the Star Wars

359
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,360
saga the Jedi are often portrayed as the

360
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Guardians of peace and Justice in the

361
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,279
Galaxy they wield incredible power and

362
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,759
are revered as wise and Noble Warriors

363
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,560
but as Yoda reveals in his final moments

364
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,199
the true strength of the Jedi lies not

365
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,199
in their ability to control the world

366
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,880
around them but in their willingness to

367
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,120
surrender to the will of the force

368
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,800
this idea is echoed in the Buddhist

369
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,639
concept of non-self or

370
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,279
anata according to this teaching our

371
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:43,880
sense of a separate unchanging self is

372
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:46,639
an illusion in reality we are constantly

373
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,440
changing interconnected beings shaped by

374
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,519
the ever shifting conditions around us

375
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,240
when we cling to the illusion of control

376
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,920
we set ourselves up for suffering we try

377
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,360
to force the world to conform to our

378
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,199
desires and expectations and we feel

379
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,839
frustrated and anxious when things don't

380
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:05,000
go our way we might even start to blame

381
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:06,480
ourselves or others for our difficulties

382
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,199
further entrenching ourselves in

383
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,680
negative patterns of thought and

384
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:15,560
behavior but as Yoda wisely reminds us

385
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,959
you must unlearn what you have learned

386
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,639
in other words we must let go of our

387
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:22,880
preconceived notions and attachments and

388
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,639
learn to flow with the natural Rhythm of

389
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,279
Life we must recognize that true power

390
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,480
comes not from trying to control the

391
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:34,120
world around us but from aligning

392
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,160
ourselves with the greater wisdom of the

393
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,680
universe think about Luke's Journey

394
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,199
throughout the Star Wars films at first

395
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,399
he is eager to learn the ways of the

396
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:45,160
force and become a powerful Jedi like

397
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,319
his father but as he grows and matures

398
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,279
he begins to realize that true Mastery

399
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:51,639
comes not from accumulating more power

400
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,600
or knowledge but from letting go of his

401
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:57,319
ego and surrendering to the will of the

402
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,040
force in the end it is this Spirit of

403
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:01,079
surrender that allows Luke to confront

404
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,720
Darth Vader and the emperor with

405
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:06,400
compassion and wisdom rather than anger

406
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,959
and aggression he recognizes that he

407
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,199
cannot control the outcome of their

408
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,839
confrontation but he can choose to act

409
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,839
with integrity and love trusting in the

410
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,839
ultimate goodness of the

411
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,400
universe so how can we apply this lesson

412
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,240
to our own

413
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,480
lives one way is to practice mindfulness

414
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,120
and self-reflection observing our

415
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,520
thoughts and reactions without judgment

416
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,280
when we catch ourselves trying to

417
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,640
control people or situations we can

418
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,039
gently remind ourselves to let go and

419
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,720
Trust in the natural unfolding of

420
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,120
life we can also cultivate a spirit of

421
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,080
curiosity and openness approaching each

422
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,200
moment with a beginner's mind instead of

423
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,400
clinging to our preconceived ideas and

424
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,200
expectations we can learn to embrace the

425
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,440
unknown and flow with the changing

426
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,280
currents of Life ultimately the lesson

427
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,640
of non-control is one of deep Trust and

428
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,520
surrender it's about recognizing that

429
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,120
while we may not always have power over

430
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,960
our external circumstances we always

431
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,440
have a choice in how we respond to them

432
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,440
by aligning ourselves with the greater

433
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,840
wisdom of the universe we can find a

434
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,400
sense of Peace purpose and freedom even

435
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,520
in the midst of life's

436
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,240
challenges so the next time you find

437
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,559
yourself struggling to control the

438
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,640
uncontrollable remember Yoda's wise

439
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:28,840
words you must unlearn what you have

440
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,919
learned let go of the illusion of

441
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,900
control and Trust in the force that

442
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:35,609
flows through us

443
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,609
[Music]

444
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,840
allous being so

445
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,919
be in The Empire Strikes Back Yoda tells

446
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:52,799
Luke you must feel the force around you

447
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:54,679
here between you me the tree The Rock

448
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,520
everywhere this simple statement

449
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,799
encapsulates a profound truth about the

450
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,880
nature of reality that we are all

451
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,039
intimately connected not just to each

452
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,919
other but to every living being in the

453
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:09,559
universe in Buddhism this idea is known

454
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,080
as dependent origination or

455
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:13,799
praam according to this teaching

456
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,520
everything in the universe arises in

457
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:19,039
dependence upon other

458
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,559
things nothing exists in isolation but

459
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,159
rather as part of a vast intricate web

460
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,320
of cause and effect stretching across

461
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,760
space and

462
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,240
time when we begin to recognize this

463
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,000
deep interconnectedness

464
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,159
it naturally gives rise to a sense of

465
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,559
compassion and empathy we realize that

466
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:39,159
our actions have consequences not just

467
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,280
for ourselves but for everyone and

468
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:42,640
everything around

469
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,360
us we start to see that our happiness

470
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,400
and suffering are intimately bound up

471
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:50,000
with the happiness and suffering of all

472
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:53,039
beings this is why Yoda is so insistent

473
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,840
on the importance of compassion and

474
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,120
selflessness he understands that true

475
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,520
power comes not from serving our own

476
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,000
narrow interests but from working for

477
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,799
the greater good of

478
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,200
all as he tells Luke a Jedi uses the

479
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:11,120
force for knowledge and defense never

480
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,240
for attack think about the moment in

481
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Return of the Jedi when Vader is dying

482
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,799
and Luke removes his mask to look upon

483
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,799
his father's face for the first time in

484
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,679
that moment Luke sees beyond the

485
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:25,000
Fearsome exterior of Darth Vader to the

486
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,360
wounded suffering human being beneath he

487
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,960
feels compassion for his father even

488
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,840
after all the terrible things he is done

489
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,919
this is the essence of the bodhisatwa

490
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,960
ideal in Buddhism the aspiration to

491
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:40,640
attain Enlightenment not just for

492
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,799
oneself but for the sake of all beings

493
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,440
like Luke we are called to look Beyond

494
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,080
superficial differences and divisions

495
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,039
and to recognize the fundamental

496
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,039
Humanity in everyone we

497
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:55,400
meet of course cultivating this kind of

498
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:57,640
compassion is not always easy it

499
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,520
requires us to confront our own biases

500
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,200
and judgments and to extend empathy and

501
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,919
understanding even to those who have

502
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:09,080
harmed us but as Yoda reminds us

503
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,440
luminous beings are we not this crude

504
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:16,279
matter in other words our true nature is

505
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,840
one of light and love not darkness and

506
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:20,559
division one powerful way to cultivate

507
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,200
compassion is through the practice of

508
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:26,080
meta or loving kindness meditation this

509
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,919
involves silently repeating phrases of

510
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,279
Goodwill and care first for ourselves

511
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:34,000
then for our loved ones then for neutral

512
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,720
parties and finally for those we find

513
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,559
difficult or

514
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,640
challenging over time this practice can

515
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,880
help us to soften our hearts and expand

516
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,279
our circle of concern to include all

517
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,120
beings we can also practice compassion

518
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:51,039
in our daily lives by looking for

519
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,880
opportunities to be of service to others

520
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,000
whether it's volunteering for a cause we

521
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,240
believe in offering a listening ear to

522
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,320
someone in need or simply performing

523
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,679
small acts of kindness and

524
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,559
generosity each action creates ripples

525
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,159
of positive change that extend far

526
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:07,400
beyond our immediate

527
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:09,640
circle as we learn to cultivate

528
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,760
compassion and recognize our

529
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,799
interconnectedness we naturally begin to

530
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,640
live with greater wisdom purpose and joy

531
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:19,720
we realize that our true happiness comes

532
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:23,120
not from serving ourselves but from

533
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,200
contributing to the well-being of all so

534
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,960
let us take Yoda's words to heart and

535
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,840
feel the force that binds us all

536
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,600
together let us practice practice

537
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,720
compassion and selflessness trusting

538
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,559
that each small act of kindness and care

539
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,240
has the power to transform not just our

540
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:40,760
own lives but the lives of countless

541
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,520
others for in the end we are all

542
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,730
luminous beings United in the vast and

543
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,600
mysterious Web of

544
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:50,720
[Music]

545
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,919
Life as we come to the end of our

546
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,520
journey exploring the profound wisdom of

547
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:57,279
Yoda and Buddhism I hope you've

548
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,840
discovered some valuable insights and

549
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,840
practices that you can take with you on

550
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:04,400
your own path whether you're a lifelong

551
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,320
Star Wars fan or a curious seeker of

552
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,559
Truth the teachings we've explored today

553
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,000
have the power to transform our lives in

554
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:14,640
countless Ways by cultivating

555
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,919
mindfulness compassion and a deep sense

556
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,520
of connection to the world around us we

557
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,559
can navigate life's challenges with

558
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,799
greater ease purpose and

559
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:27,320
joy but the path of wisdom is not always

560
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:30,480
an easy one there will be times when we

561
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,320
feel lost discouraged or overwhelmed by

562
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,320
the darkness in ourselves and the world

563
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,320
around us in those moments it's

564
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,080
important to remember that we are never

565
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,919
alone like Luke Skywalker we have the

566
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,679
support of wise teachers caring friends

567
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:47,520
and the Boundless Energy of the force

568
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:49,520
that surrounds and sustains us so as you

569
