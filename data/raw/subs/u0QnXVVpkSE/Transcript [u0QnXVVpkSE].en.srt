1
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:09,500
imagine being lost in a dense forest

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,958
night falling quickly

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,333
you hear the growl of wild animals nearby

4
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:16,500
in this moment of danger who would you call

5
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:20,208
now imagine achieving your greatest life goal

6
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,500
standing at the summit of your success

7
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,500
in this moment of triumph

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,166
who would you want beside you

9
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:32,208
what if I told you the 2,500 years ago

10
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,375
Buddha already knew exactly which four

11
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,791
people you'd need in both situations

12
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:39,083
and that

13
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,375
knowing this could completely transform your life

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,208
in our last video we exposed Buddha's warning

15
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:49,000
about the 4 types of people who will ruin your life

16
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,833
today we reveal the opposite

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,000
the 4 true friends Buddha said

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,166
everyone needs for both survival and enlightenment

19
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,000
welcome back to Buddha's wisdom

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,250
I'm Peter and today

21
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,500
we're exploring one of Buddha's most practical

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,000
and profound teachings

23
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,500
one that could reshape your entire Social Circle

24
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,416
in the ancient Sigalovada Sutta

25
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,750
Buddha encountered a young man named Sigala

26
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,458
performing elaborate rituals

27
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,500
to protect himself from harm

28
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,500
coming from six directions

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,750
Buddha stopped

30
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,458
and offered him a completely different understanding

31
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:29,208
instead of empty rituals true Protection

32
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,333
comes from how we cultivate relationships

33
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,458
in every direction of our lives

34
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:37,208
among these teachings was a priceless gem

35
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:38,625
the four types of true friends

36
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,833
that create an unshakeable foundation

37
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:44,833
for both worldly success and spiritual growth

38
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:48,500
Buddha called this concept kalyāṇa-mittatā

39
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,666
noble friendship

40
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,708
and he didn't mince words about its importance

41
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:57,041
in the Upaddha Sutta he declared to his attendant Ananda

42
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:00,333
this is the entire holy life Ananda

43
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,541
namely good friendship

44
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,750
good companionship good comradeship

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,416
today science confirms what Buddha new millennia ago

46
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,666
Harvard's 80 year study on happiness

47
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,416
discovered that close relationships keep us happier

48
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,166
healthier and help us live longer

49
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:20,458
more than money fame or social status

50
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,791
so who are these 4 essential friends

51
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:27,000
how do you find them and most importantly

52
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,541
how do you become one yourself

53
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,166
let's discover Buddha's timeless blueprint

54
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,125
for the relationships that will transform your life

55
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,916
before we jump into the four

56
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,000
specific types of true friends

57
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,125
let's understand

58
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,000
what made Buddhist teaching on friendship

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,583
so revolutionary

60
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:50,791
in an age

61
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,458
when spiritual seekers often abandoned society

62
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,958
for solitary meditation

63
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,458
and forests Buddha took a radical stance

64
00:02:59,083 --> 00:02:59,750
he said that

65
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,958
spiritual friendship isn't just helpful for

66
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:02,833
enlightenment

67
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,500
it's essential

68
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,166
in one famous exchange Buddha's cousin

69
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:08,791
Ananda

70
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,791
suggested that noble friends are half of the holy life

71
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,000
Buddha immediately corrected him

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,250
do not say that Ananda

73
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:20,416
noble friendship is the whole of the holy life

74
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,791
this wasn't just spiritual theory

75
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,708
Buddha understood human psychology

76
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:29,500
at its core we become like those we spend time with

77
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,916
our minds are shaped by our companions

78
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,500
our habits influenced by our inner circle

79
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,583
think about it when you're around negative people

80
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,458
doesn't your mind start generating negative thoughts

81
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,041
and when you're with inspiring friends

82
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,666
don't you feel your potential expanding

83
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:54,000
Buddha called this profound connection kalyāṇa-mittatā

84
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,041
which translates as a spiritual friendship

85
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,625
or noble friendship

86
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,458
it's the foundation that makes all other

87
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,500
spiritual progress possible

88
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,166
but Buddha didn't leave this teaching vague

89
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,375
with his characteristic precision

90
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:12,083
he identified exactly four types of friends we all need

91
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,375
each serving a specific purpose

92
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,125
in our journey through life

93
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,541
the first type of true friend

94
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,875
Buddha identified as the helper friend

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,500
or upakāraka-mitta in Pali

96
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,833
this isn't just someone who occasionally does you favor

97
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,000
Buddha described four

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,875
specific qualities that define this precious ally

99
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,708
first they protect you when you're vulnerable

100
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,500
when you're sick distracted

101
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,166
or in a moment of weakness

102
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,375
this friend stands guard

103
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,875
they ensure no harm comes to you

104
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,666
when you can't protect yourself

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,916
second they protect your property when you're unable

106
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,958
in Buddha's time

107
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,500
this might have meant watching your home during travel

108
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,500
today it could be the friend who waters your plants

109
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,583
feeds your pet

110
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,166
or make sure your business runs smoothly

111
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,333
during a crisis

112
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,125
third they provide refuge in times of danger

113
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,375
when threats appear whether physical

114
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:14,458
emotional or spiritual this friend offers sanctuary

115
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,500
a safe harbor in life storms

116
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,750
fourth when you need help

117
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,583
they supply more than requested

118
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,333
they don't calculate or measure their assistance

119
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:27,458
their generosity exceeds expectations

120
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,250
going beyond the call of duty

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,458
think of the friend who drove across town at midnight

122
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,000
when your car broke down the one who brought you

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,875
not just soup when you were sick

124
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,500
but cleaned your house and stocked your fridge

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,083
the person who didn't just listen to your troubles

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,333
but actively helped solve them

127
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,250
interestingly Buddha

128
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,208
didn't say this friend needs to be wealthy or powerful

129
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,458
help comes in many forms sometimes

130
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,875
the most valuable help is simply unwavering presence

131
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,833
during our darkest hours

132
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,250
let me share a story

133
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,750
that perfectly illustrates this type of friendship

134
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,333
from the Buddha's own life

135
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,875
when Buddha fell seriously ill

136
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,791
his attendant Ananda never left his side

137
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,375
he fetched water

138
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,500
administered medicine and cared for his physical needs

139
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,125
but more importantly

140
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,208
Ananda provided something no doctor could

141
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:27,083
constant companionship and comfort during suffering

142
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,166
in your own life

143
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,791
think about who shows up when you're at your lowest

144
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,583
who takes action without being asked

145
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,833
who anticipates your needs before you even express them

146
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,916
that person embodies the helper friend

147
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,666
but here's a crucial question

148
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,875
are you this type of friend to others

149
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,416
do you protect them in their moments of vulnerability

150
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,333
do you go beyond what's requested

151
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,833
when giving assistance

152
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,375
Buddha taught

153
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,000
the true friendship isn't just about receiving

154
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,750
it's about reciprocity

155
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,791
about being the friend you wish to have

156
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,000
the second type of true friend

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,583
Buddha identified is perhaps

158
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,375
the rarest and most valuable

159
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,958
the enduring friend or samānasukhadukkha-mitta

160
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,125
which literally means

161
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:22,500
the friend who is the same in happiness and sorrow

162
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,958
unlike fair-weather friends

163
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,791
who disappear when times get tough

164
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,000
or success leeches

165
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,916
who only appear when you're thriving

166
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,000
this friend remains constant through all of life

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,833
seasons

168
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,208
Buddha described

169
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,125
four powerful qualities of the steadfast companion

170
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,416
first they confide their secrets to you

171
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,333
this shows profound trust

172
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,041
the bedrock of any lasting relationship

173
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,000
they make themselves vulnerable

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,208
by sharing what they hide from others

175
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,000
second they keep your secret safe

176
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,541
what you share and confidence stays protected

177
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,666
your vulnerability is honored

178
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,625
never exploited or casually revealed

179
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,708
third and perhaps most importantly

180
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,041
they do not abandon you in times of trouble

181
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,916
while the helper friend

182
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,708
actively rescues you from immediate dangers

183
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,000
the enduring friend offers something different

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
but equally vital unwavering presence

185
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,375
through life's extended difficulties

186
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,916
when your reputation suffers

187
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,333
when you face chronic illness

188
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,208
when you're working through personal struggles

189
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,041
they maintain the same warm relationship

190
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,791
without judgment or distance

191
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:32,958
fourth

192
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,875
they would sacrifice even their life for your sake

193
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,416
while this might sound extreme

194
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,416
Buddha

195
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,541
was emphasizing the ultimate loyalty of this friend

196
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,750
they value your well being above their own comfort

197
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,875
or convenience in Buddhist literature

198
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,958
the classic example is Buddhist disciple Ananda

199
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,708
who stayed loyal through every hardship

200
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,166
when the Buddha's cousin Devadatta tried to kill him

201
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,750
when his community faced splits and challenges

202
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,375
Ananda's dedication never wavered

203
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,125
this type of friendship transcend circumstance

204
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,166
it's not conditional on your success status

205
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,791
or what you can provide

206
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,333
it's founded on something much deeper

207
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,666
think about your own life

208
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,291
who has stayed with you through your darkest moments

209
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,500
who didn't walk away when you had nothing to offer

210
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:27,041
who celebrates your success without a hint of jealousy

211
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,250
these rare individuals fulfill Buddha's description

212
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,875
of the enduring friend

213
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,875
they're the ones who say

214
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,083
we'll figure this out together

215
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,250
when everyone else has disappeared

216
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,958
it's fascinating

217
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,875
how Buddha's insights align with modern psychology

218
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,041
studies show that close relationships

219
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,083
not wealth or status

220
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,541
are the greatest predictors of long term happiness

221
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,250
this friend provides what researchers call

222
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,833
a secure attachment a foundation of trust

223
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,416
that helps us navigate life's uncertainties

224
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,458
but remember for this friendship to thrive

225
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,958
you must reciprocate

226
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,208
are you willing to keep confidences

227
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,833
do you remain steadfast

228
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,875
when your friends face difficulties

229
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,083
or do you subtly distance yourself

230
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,958
when association with them becomes uncomfortable

231
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,541
Buddha teaches that becoming an enduring friend

232
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,125
requires courage

233
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:25,625
loyalty and a heart that values people over convenience

234
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,166
the third essential friend Buddha identified is perhaps

235
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,708
the most challenging to find in today's world

236
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,750
the good counselor or atthakkhāyī-mitta

237
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,791
the friend who points you toward what is beneficial

238
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:45,000
in an age of endless validation and echo chambers

239
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,958
this friend stands apart

240
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,041
they're not concerned with simply agreeing with you

241
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,458
they're committed to your highest good

242
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,250
even when that requires difficult truth

243
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,708
Buddha outlined four

244
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,250
distinct qualities of this wise counselor

245
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,291
first they restrain you from wrongdoing

246
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,875
when they see you about to make a harmful choice

247
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,791
they don't remain silent

248
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,333
they have the courage to intervene

249
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,500
to help you avoid actions you'll later regret

250
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,000
second they encourage you toward good

251
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,125
beyond just preventing mistakes

252
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,500
they actively guide you toward positive actions

253
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,083
highlighting opportunities for growth and virtue

254
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,833
third they inform you of what you didn't know

255
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,833
this friend shares knowledge

256
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:35,000
wisdom and perspective that expands your understanding

257
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,166
they help you see blind spots

258
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,291
and fill gaps in your awareness

259
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,333
fourth they show the path to spiritual progress

260
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,625
they don't just help with worldly success

261
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,916
they nurture your deeper development as a human being

262
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,458
pointing toward lasting fulfillment

263
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,500
rather than temporary pleasure

264
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,916
in the Buddhist tradition

265
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,250
this relationship is so powerful

266
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,541
it's often formalized as the teacher student bond

267
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,000
yet it also exists in humble

268
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,208
everyday friendships

269
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,916
between people committed to each other's growth

270
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,416
the Buddha himself

271
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,583
demonstrated this type of friendship countless times

272
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,791
remember Angulimala from our previous video

273
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,708
when the serial killer was on his destructive path

274
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,708
Buddha didn't just offer advice from a safe distance

275
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,541
he courageously confronted him directly

276
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,458
using both wisdom and compassion

277
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:30,375
to transform this feared murderer into a peaceful monk

278
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,208
Buddha saw potential for good

279
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,375
where others saw only evil

280
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,500
actively leading Angulimala to renounce violence

281
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,666
rather than simply counseling him about it

282
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,083
in your life who tells you what you need to hear

283
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,791
not just what you want to hear

284
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,041
who challenges your perspectives

285
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,916
when they see you headed down a harmful path

286
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,208
who expands your thinking

287
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,416
rather than simply echoing your existing views

288
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,708
this friend is invaluable

289
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,291
because they help us overcome

290
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,333
our greatest obstacle to growth

291
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,875
our own limited perspective

292
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,500
we all have blind spots biases and areas of ignorance

293
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,541
the good counselor helps us

294
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,583
see beyond these limitations

295
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,583
however

296
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,375
this friendship requires something from you as well

297
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,333
humility

298
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,708
can you receive guidance without defensiveness

299
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,375
can you value truth over comfort

300
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,166
can you trust that temporary discomfort

301
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,875
might lead to lasting benefit

302
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,625
and when you counsel others

303
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,041
do you speak with genuine compassion

304
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,541
or with subtle superiority

305
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:41,666
a true good counselor guides without judgment

306
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,208
advises without attachment to being right

307
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,583
corrects without diminishing the other's dignity

308
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,166
the fourth and final true friend Buddha identified

309
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,500
completes the circle of support we all need

310
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,916
the compassionate friend or anukampaka-mitta

311
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,083
the friend whose heart resonates with yours

312
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,000
this friend embodies what Buddha considered

313
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,833
the highest virtues genuine empathy and unselfish joy

314
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,541
they mirror your emotional experiences

315
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,166
in a way that halves your sorrows

316
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:19,291
and doubles your joys Buddha described four

317
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,291
beautiful qualities of this compassionate companion

318
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,833
first they do not rejoice in your misfortune

319
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,458
when you stumble or fail

320
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,625
there's not even a hint of secret satisfaction

321
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,416
no subtle I told you so

322
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,208
or quiet pleasure in your setbacks

323
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:40,000
second they genuinely rejoice in your good fortune

324
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,583
your success brings them authentic happiness

325
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,708
untainted by envy or comparison

326
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,750
they celebrate your achievements

327
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,208
as if they were their own

328
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,875
third they prevent others from speaking ill of you

329
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,250
they defend your character in your absence

330
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,500
refusing to participate in gossip

331
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,666
or criticism that diminishes you

332
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,083
fourth

333
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,083
they encourage others who praise your good qualities

334
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,416
they amplify positive recognition of your virtues

335
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,666
and accomplishments

336
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,500
supporting your good reputation among others

337
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,708
this friend embodies what Buddhists call mudita

338
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:18,208
sympathetic joy and karuna compassion

339
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,833
while the good counselor guides your actions

340
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:21,750
with wisdom

341
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:25,333
the compassionate friend connects with your emotions

342
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,166
with heart

343
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,791
one helps you do better

344
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,500
the other helps you feel understood

345
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,583
together they create an emotional sanctuary

346
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,875
where you can be fully yourself

347
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,708
in the Buddhist traditions

348
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,791
the perfect example

349
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,083
is Sariputta's friendship with Moggallana

350
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:48,500
when one succeeded the other celebrated wholeheartedly

351
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,166
when one faced challenges

352
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,083
the other felt genuine concern

353
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,125
their bond showcased how true compassion creates space

354
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,333
for both joy and sorrow

355
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,333
to be shared authentically

356
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,166
think about your relationships

357
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,041
who genuinely celebrates your wins

358
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,000
without comparing them to their own situation

359
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,916
who feels your pain without making it about themselves

360
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,291
who defends your reputation when you're not in the room

361
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,166
these rare individuals

362
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,375
exemplify the compassionate friend

363
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:27,000
that Buddha described and science confirms their value

364
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,500
studies show that having empathetic friends

365
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,000
significantly reduces stress hormones

366
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,583
during difficult times

367
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,625
their presence literally changes our biochemistry

368
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,875
but compassion must flow both ways

369
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,625
do you find sincere joy in others success

370
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,166
or does their achievement trigger subtle comparison

371
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,500
or insecurity

372
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,666
can you stand firmly for others reputations

373
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,416
when it would be easier to join in criticism

374
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,375
Buddha taught that developing compassionate friendship

375
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,041
requires

376
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,666
constant mindfulness of our reactions to others

377
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,208
fortunes both good and bad

378
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,000
it means cultivating a heart that resonates with others

379
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,500
without self reference

380
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,541
now that we understand the four types of friends

381
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,916
Buddha said we all need an important question remains

382
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,750
how do we attract these friends into our lives

383
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,291
Buddha's answer was simple yet profound

384
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,375
become these friends for others

385
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,958
the helper friend

386
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,833
the enduring friend of the good counselor

387
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,291
the compassionate friend

388
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,750
these aren't just people to seek out

389
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,375
they represent qualities to cultivate within ourselves

390
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,333
Buddha taught that relationships mirror

391
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,583
our own qualities

392
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,291
the friendship we offer

393
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,666
determines the friendship we receive

394
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,500
this is karma in its most practical form

395
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
so how do we develop these qualities

396
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,541
Buddha suggested specific practices

397
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,375
to become a helper friend

398
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:01,875
practice Dana generosity without expectation of return

399
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,625
look for opportunities to assist others

400
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,291
before they even ask

401
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,125
consider what skills or resources you have

402
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,916
that could ease someone else's burden

403
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,041
to become an enduring friend

404
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,625
practice adhiṭṭhāna determination in your relationships

405
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,625
make and keep promises

406
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,750
stay present during others difficulties

407
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:27,208
instead of withdrawing share appropriately of yourself

408
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,416
while honoring others confidences

409
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,708
to become a good counselor

410
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,750
develop pañña wisdom through study and reflection

411
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,833
speak truthfully but with perfect timing

412
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,166
offer guidance with compassion rather than judgment

413
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,625
continue your own learnings

414
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,666
you have genuine insight to share

415
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,791
to become a compassionate friend

416
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:52,583
cultivate both Karuna compassion and mudita

417
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,208
sympathetic joy

418
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,833
practice seeing other success as beneficial to all

419
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,416
train yourself to recognize and challenge

420
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,583
envious thoughts

421
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,208
defend others reputations as carefully as your own

422
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,375
these qualities don't develop overnight

423
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,791
they require consistent practice and sincere intention

424
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,583
Buddha taught that friendship is both an art

425
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,750
and a discipline

426
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,875
one powerful practice is to reflect daily on your

427
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,041
interactions

428
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,708
ask yourself

429
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,833
did I help someone today without being asked

430
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,791
did I remain loyal

431
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,083
when it would have been easier to walk away

432
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,750
did I offer beneficial guidance

433
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,250
rather than mere agreement

434
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,583
did I genuinely celebrate someone else's good fortune

435
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,625
Buddhist texts suggest meditating

436
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,291
specifically on friendship

437
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,291
visualize each person in your life

438
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,583
and extend loving kindness toward them

439
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,916
this gradually transforms how you relate to others

440
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,333
at a fundamental level

441
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,625
remember also what we Learned in our previous video

442
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,666
just as important as cultivating true friends

443
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:04,583
is avoiding false ones those who take but never give

444
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,916
those who speak sweetly but act harmfully

445
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,125
those who flatter to your face

446
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,083
but undermine you behind your back

447
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,083
those who join you in destructive behaviors

448
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:17,833
Buddhist teaching

449
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,291
offers a complete approach to relationships

450
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,833
both who to embrace

451
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,416
and who to mindfully keep at a distance

452
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,500
as we've discovered today

453
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,333
Buddha's wisdom on friendship isn't just spiritual

454
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:33,875
theory

455
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:37,333
it's practical psychology for living a fulfilled life

456
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,666
the helper friend protects us in vulnerable moments

457
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,416
the enduring friend remains constant

458
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,208
through all circumstances

459
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,666
the good counselor guides us toward beneficial choices

460
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,208
the compassionate friend shares authentically

461
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,333
in our joys and sorrows together

462
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,625
these four create a complete support system

463
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:58,750
for both worldly success and spiritual growth

464
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,583
they form the safety net that allows us to take risks

465
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,375
the mirror that helps us see ourselves clearly

466
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,875
the sanctuary where we can be authentic

467
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,833
the guidance that helps us evolve

468
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,375
Buddha taught that noble friendship

469
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,458
isn't a luxury

470
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,208
it's the very foundation of a meaningful life

471
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:21,833
as he told Ananda it's the whole of the holy life

472
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:26,291
in our hyper connected yet increasingly isolated world

473
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,250
this ancient wisdom

474
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,333
offers a pathway back to what truly matters

475
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,208
deep authentic human connection

476
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,333
built on mutual benefit and genuine care

477
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,041
so look around at your relationships

478
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,375
do you have these four friends in your life

479
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,083
more importantly

480
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,000
are you cultivating these qualities within yourself

481
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:49,583
remember

482
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:52,458
the friends we attract reflect the friendship we offer

483
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,500
by embodying these four types of true friendship

484
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,250
we create the conditions for them to appear

485
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,625
in our own lives

486
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,500
if you found value in Buddha's wisdom on friendship

487
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,583
take the Buddhist Friendship Challenge

488
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,375
for the next 7 days

489
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,291
practice one quality from each friend type

490
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:15,083
and notice how your relationships transform

491
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:21,083
screenshot this moment showing the four friend types

492
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,666
and share it with someone

493
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,958
who embodies these qualities in your life

494
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,750
in the comments below tell us

495
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,458
which of these 4 friendship types

496
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,583
do you already have in your life

497
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,166
or which one are you most determined to become

498
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,041
for others

499
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:39,208
your insights might help someone else recognize

500
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,541
the true friends around them

501
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
for those interested in diving deeper

506
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,291
and become one yourself

507
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:01,583
this is Peter from Buddha's wisdom

508
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,291
