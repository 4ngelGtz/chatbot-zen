1
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:26,800
I'm Matt from Buddha's wisdom

2
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,300
and today

3
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,266
we're exploring a religious controversy so explosive

4
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:31,100
it threatens to

5
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,500
rewrite the history of eastern spirituality

6
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,566
imagine this Buddha

7
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,100
the enlightened sage

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,166
who founded one of the world's great religions

9
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:46,500
might be a Hindu god in disguise

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,833
you heard that right

11
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:54,166
some Hindus claim Buddha was an Avatar of Vishnu

12
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:56,500
sent to earth as part of a divine plan

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,700
but here's where it gets wild

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,766
Buddhists are fighting back hard

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,966
they're saying this claim isn't divine revelation

16
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:06,000
it's a spiritual hijacking

17
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:09,666
in the next 20 minutes

18
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,266
we're going to unravel this mystery

19
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:12,866
that's dividing millions

20
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:15,866
you'll hear mind blowing arguments from both sides

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,100
you'll discover ancient texts that hinted hidden truths

22
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,000
and you'll learn about a shocking theory

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,166
that could turn this whole debate upside down

24
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:27,366
by the end of this video you'll question everything

25
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:27,733
you thought

26
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:30,666
you knew about these two major world religions

27
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,933
brace yourselves

28
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:34,433
for a journey into the heart of eastern spirituality

29
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:37,533
before we jump in I want to emphasize

30
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:39,900
that our goal is to explore and educate

31
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,033
not to offend or disrespect any religious beliefs

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,466
we're tackling complex

33
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:46,766
historical and philosophical questions

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,300
and we acknowledge the deep

35
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,900
personal significance these matters hold for many

36
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:53,966
this video aims to present various perspectives

37
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:55,600
for educational purposes

38
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:57,866
encouraging open minded discussion

39
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,600
and mutual understanding

40
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,466
now before we plunge into

41
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:07,266
the heart of this religious firestorm

42
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:11,166
we need to understand the players in this cosmic drama

43
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,166
on one side we have Hinduism

44
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:18,933
ancient complex with a pantheon of gods

45
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:20,366
that would make the Greek Olympians

46
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:22,466
look like a small family gathering

47
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,000
at its core stands Vishnu the preserver

48
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,066
taking on various forms to maintain cosmic order

49
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,933
on the other side Buddhism emerges

50
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,433
as a radical departure from Hindu traditions

51
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:37,700
founded by Siddhartha Gautama

52
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,900
who became the Buddha

53
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,266
it rejects the very idea of a supreme deity

54
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:45,100
instead it offers a path to enlightenment

55
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,966
through personal effort and wisdom

56
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:52,033
these two spiritual titans have coexisted for millennia

57
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:54,100
shaping the beliefs of billions

58
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:57,400
for instance in the ancient city of Varanasi

59
00:02:57,733 --> 00:03:00,433
you can find both the Kashi Vishwanath temple

60
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,600
one of the most sacred Hindu sites

61
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,866
and Sarnath where Buddha gave his first sermon

62
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:07,400
just a few miles apart

63
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:11,100
this physical proximity mirrors the complex

64
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,766
spiritual intertwining we're about to explore

65
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:15,833
they've influenced each other

66
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,200
clashed and at times even merged

67
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,900
but beneath this uneasy coexistence

68
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,100
lies a controversy that threatens to upend

69
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,066
our understanding of both faiths

70
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,000
picture this a Hindu text

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,066
casually mentioning Buddha as one of Vishnu's avatars

72
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:38,600
it's like finding out Superman and Batman

73
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:39,966
are the same person

74
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:42,833
this seemingly innocuous claim

75
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,400
ignites a philosophical powder keg

76
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:48,866
Hindu see it as a natural inclusion of a great teacher

77
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,100
Buddhists?

78
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,766
they view it as a fundamental misunderstanding or worse

79
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,200
a deliberate distortion of their founders

80
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,066
identity and teachings

81
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:02,000
the stakes? nothing less than the very foundations of

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,666
these two world religions

83
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:06,966
if Buddha is indeed an Avatar of Vishnu

84
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:09,100
it reshapes Buddhism as we know it

85
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,366
if he's not

86
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:13,266
it calls into questions centuries of Hindu tradition

87
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:16,333
either way millions of believers

88
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,066
are caught in the crossfire of this spiritual showdown

89
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,800
now let's drop the Hindu bombshell

90
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,566
that's been shaking

91
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,400
the foundations of eastern religion

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,300
some Hindu traditions boldly claim Buddha

93
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,566
as the 9th Avatar of Vishnu

94
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,800
this isn't some obscure theory

95
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,000
cooked up in a dusty corner of academia

96
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,000
we're talking about a belief held by millions of Hindus

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,866
worldwide The Bhagavata Purana

98
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,333
a sacred Hindu text

99
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,766
lists Buddha among vishnus incarnations

100
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,900
it explicitly states...

101
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,500
it describes him as a divine being

102
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,700
who appeared to delude those unworthy of Vedic rituals

103
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,033
think about the implications

104
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,033
this ancient text essentially says

105
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,600
Buddha's entire mission was part of Vishnu's grand plan

106
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:15,600
but it doesn't stop there

107
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:17,900
some Hindu scholars argue

108
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,333
Buddha's teachings align perfectly with Vishnu's role

109
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,866
as the preserver of dharma

110
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:24,600
they point to Buddha's emphasis on compassion

111
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,100
and his efforts to reform harmful practices

112
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:31,066
in their eyes Buddha wasn't rebelling against Hinduism

113
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:34,766
he was fulfilling his divine duty as Vishnu's Avatar

114
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,866
this perspective turns the

115
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:39,000
entire narrative of Buddhism on its head

116
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:41,733
it suggests Buddha's rejection of the cast system

117
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,366
and Vedic rituals wasn't a break

118
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:46,200
from Hinduism but a purification of it

119
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,066
it paints Buddha not as the founder of a new religion

120
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,966
but as a Hindu reformer sent by Vishnu himself

121
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,600
the evidence they present is compelling

122
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,266
they highlight

123
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:57,666
philosophical similarities between Buddhism

124
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,600
and certain schools of Hindu thought

125
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:03,233
they point to shared concepts like karma and rebirth

126
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,266
some even argue that Buddha's Noble

127
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:08,000
Eightfold Path is a refined version of Hindu

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,233
ethical teachings

129
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:13,500
make no mistake this claim isn't a peace offering

130
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,333
it's a theological power move

131
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,333
that threatens to absorb Buddhism back into

132
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,166
the Hindu fold and as you might expect

133
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,500
Buddhists aren't taking this lying down

134
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:30,300
but Buddhism isn't about to roll over

135
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,666
and let its founder be claimed by Hinduism

136
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,633
the Buddhist community has come out swinging

137
00:06:35,866 --> 00:06:38,566
and their counter arguments pack a serious punch

138
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,000
first and foremost Buddhist

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,933
point to the fundamental teachings of the Buddha

140
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:43,800
himself

141
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,233
they often cite Buddha's own words from the Dīgha Nikāya

142
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:55,900
in numerous sutras

143
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,333
Buddha explicitly rejected the idea of a supreme

144
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,400
creator god

145
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,500
he taught that the universe operates on natural laws

146
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:05,366
not divine will for Buddhists

147
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:08,066
the very notion of Buddha as an Avatar of Vishnu

148
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:10,400
contradicts the core of their doctrine

149
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,566
Buddhist scholars argue that the concept of Buddha

150
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,800
as Vishnu's Avatar is a later Hindu invention

151
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:19,200
absent from early Buddhist texts

152
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,200
they see it as an

153
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,933
attempt to undermine Buddhism's distinct identity

154
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,866
and reabsorb it into Hinduism

155
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,700
it's not interfaith dialogue they're seeing

156
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,766
it's spiritual colonization

157
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:31,566
moreover Buddhist

158
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:34,233
emphasized the historical Buddhist human origins

159
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,000
Siddhartha Gautama was born a prince

160
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:39,100
struggled with existential questions

161
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:41,633
and achieved enlightenment through his own efforts

162
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,500
this narrative of human potential

163
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,266
is central to Buddhist philosophy

164
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,100
claiming Buddha as a divine Avatar

165
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,000
they argue robs his story of its power

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,866
and relevance to ordinary people

167
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:55,066
the Buddhist push back

168
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:57,166
goes beyond philosophical arguments

169
00:07:57,366 --> 00:07:58,133
they're calling out

170
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:00,733
what they see as a pattern of Hindu appropriation

171
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:02,833
of Buddhist sights and symbols

172
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,366
from Bodh Gaya to Buddha statues in Hindu temples

173
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,966
Buddhists are reclaiming their cultural

174
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:11,400
and spiritual heritage in 2013

175
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,166
the Global Buddhist Conference in New Delhi

176
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,300
saw heated debates

177
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,300
when some Hindu speakers referred to Buddha

178
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,700
as a Hindu reformer

179
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:20,500
Buddhist delegates walked out in protest

180
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,000
showing how this controversy plays out in real world

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,433
interface dialogues

182
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:27,666
some Buddhist leaders have gone as far as to suggest

183
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:27,933
that

184
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:30,800
the Avatar claim is a form of spiritual aggression

185
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,666
they argue it's part of a broader attempt to

186
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,400
erase Buddhism's distinct identity

187
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,866
in its land of origin

188
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,900
for them this isn't about religious harmony

189
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:42,633
it's about survival

190
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:46,266
the Buddhist response turns this controversy

191
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:49,000
into a battle for the very soul of their religion

192
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,833
it's not a fight they're planning to lose

193
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,333
now hold on to your seats

194
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:58,700
because

195
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,000
we're about to throw a historical plot twist into this

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,266
religious showdown

197
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:04,200
the roots of this controversy

198
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,000
run deeper and darker than you might imagine

199
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:10,100
cast your mind back to ancient India

200
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,800
around 500 BCE

201
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,366
Buddhism erupts onto the scene

202
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:16,666
challenging the established Hindu order

203
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:18,766
it rejects the cast system

204
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,666
questions the authority of the Vedas

205
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:23,900
and offers a path to enlightenment open to all

206
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:25,866
suddenly

207
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,766
Hinduism faces its first major ideological rival

208
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:29,833
on home turf

209
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:32,200
fast forward a few centuries

210
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:34,333
Buddhism is spreading like wildfire

211
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,866
across the subcontinent and beyond

212
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:41,033
Hindu temples are being abandoned

213
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:44,633
the social hierarchy is under threat

214
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:46,466
the response

215
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:49,966
a Hindu renaissance begins to take shape

216
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,200
this is where things get murky

217
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,933
some historians argue

218
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:56,400
the inclusion of Buddha as Vishnu's Avatar

219
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,166
wasn't a gesture of respect

220
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:00,300
but a calculated move in a high stakes

221
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,700
religious chess game

222
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:05,133
the goal to neutralize the Buddhist threat

223
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,966
by claiming its founder as their own

224
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,633
by portraying Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu

225
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:12,600
Hindu leaders could argue

226
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,566
that Buddhism wasn't a separate religion

227
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:17,266
at all it was Hinduism all along

228
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,100
it's a brilliant strategy

229
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:22,200
it allows them to acknowledge Buddha's undeniable

230
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,000
impact while simultaneously

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,366
undercutting Buddhism's distinct identity

232
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:30,566
but here's the kicker this tactic might have backfired

233
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:33,166
instead of weakening Buddhism

234
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,700
it may have contributed to its decline in India

235
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,666
why follow Buddha's teachings

236
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,966
when you can worship him directly as Vishnu

237
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:43,200
it's a twist worthy of a historical thriller

238
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,366
consider the case of Bodhgaya

239
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,200
Buddhism's holiest site

240
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,133
over centuries

241
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:52,900
it was gradually absorbed into Hindu worship

242
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:54,966
with a Shaivite monastery established

243
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:58,766
there it wasn't until the 19th century that Buddhist

244
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:00,700
supported by British archaeologist

245
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,466
reclaimed it as a Buddhist site

246
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,133
this perspective

247
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:06,666
transforms our understanding of the controversy

248
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,166
it's not a theological debate

249
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:12,233
it's the aftershock of an ancient culture war

250
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:15,966
the Avatar claim becomes less about spiritual truth

251
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,833
and more about religious politics and power struggles

252
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:22,966
of course this interpretation is hotly debated

253
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:26,400
some see it as an overly cynical view of a complex

254
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,833
historical process

255
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:31,200
others argue it's a necessary correction to sanitized

256
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,866
versions of religious history

257
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,666
either way it adds a layer of intrigue to our story

258
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,133
the question isn't "was Buddha and Avatar of Vishnu?"

259
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,633
it's "why would anyone claim he was?"

260
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:47,300
and suddenly we're not talking about ancient mythology

261
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:49,200
we're talking about the raw

262
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,066
real world forces that shape religious traditions

263
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,400
it's time for the main event

264
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,700
the evidence showdown

265
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,466
both sides are bringing their A-game

266
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:03,933
armed with ancient texts

267
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:06,833
philosophical arguments and historical analysis

268
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,366
let's break it down

269
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:12,866
in the Hindu corner we have the heavy hitters

270
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,533
The Bhagavata Purana

271
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,833
explicitly lists Buddha as the ninth Avatar of Vishnu

272
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:20,866
the Gitagovinda a 12th century text

273
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:25,033
echoes this claim: The Gitagovinda by Jayadeva proclaims

274
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:42,933
these aren't obscure writings

275
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:45,666
they're foundational texts for millions of Hindus

276
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:49,500
Hindu scholars also point to philosophical parallels

277
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,000
Buddhist emphasis on compassion?

278
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:52,933
they argue

279
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:55,500
it's a reflection of Vishnu's role as the preserver

280
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,833
the Buddhist concept of Nirvana?

281
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,466
they draw comparisons to the Hindu idea of moksha

282
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,533
it's a tapestry of connections that at first glance

283
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,666
seems compelling

284
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,666
but the Buddhist camp isn't backing down

285
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,800
they're wielding the Pali Canon

286
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:14,733
the earliest Buddhist texts

287
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:17,166
which make no mention of Vishnu or avatars

288
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:18,300
instead

289
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,800
these writings present Buddha as a human teacher

290
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,766
who rejected the very idea of creator gods

291
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,500
Buddhist also bring linguistic evidence to the table

292
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,300
they argue the Sanskrit word “avatara”

293
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,800
doesn't appear in early Buddhist literature

294
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,133
it's later used in some Buddhist texts

295
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:37,266
they claim was metaphorical

296
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:38,300
not literal

297
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:41,000
the plot thickens when we look at timing

298
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:42,300
the earliest

299
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,566
clear references to Buddha as Vishnu's Avatar

300
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:46,233
date back to the Gupta period

301
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:48,066
centuries after Buddhist time

302
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,566
Buddhist argue

303
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:52,766
this gap exposes the Avatar claim as a later invention

304
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,566
not an original truth

305
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,166
art history throws another curveball into the mix

306
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,966
early Buddhist art doesn't depict Buddha as a deity

307
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,700
it's only in later centuries that we see Buddha

308
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,433
like figures incorporated into Hindu iconography

309
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:10,200
is this evidence of assimilation or appropriation

310
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:13,700
archaeological findings muddy the waters further

311
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,866
Buddha stupas repurposed as Hindu temples

312
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,033
Buddha statues with Hindu features added later

313
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,000
at the Ellora Caves in Maharashtra

314
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:24,900
you can see this controversy literally

315
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,300
carved in stone

316
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,933
Cave 10 features a Buddha figure

317
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:31,600
while neighboring caves depict Hindu deities

318
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:32,733
some

319
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:35,400
scholars argue that the similarities in artistic style

320
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,866
suggest

321
00:14:35,866 --> 00:14:38,766
a deliberate attempt to incorporate Buddhist imagery

322
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:40,600
into Hindu contexts

323
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,566
these sites become battlegrounds for competing

324
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:46,800
historical narratives as the evidence piles up

325
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,066
it becomes clear

326
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:51,066
this isn't a simple case of right versus wrong

327
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,900
it's a clash of world views

328
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:55,100
each supported by its own body of evidence

329
00:14:55,766 --> 00:14:58,166
the question isn't "who has more proof?"

330
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,100
it's "how do we interpret the proof we have?"

331
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,600
and trust me this evidence showdown is far from over

332
00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:07,100
with each new archaeological discovery

333
00:15:07,266 --> 00:15:09,600
each reinterpretation of ancient texts

334
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:12,766
the debate evolves it's a living controversy

335
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,266
as dynamic today as it was centuries ago

336
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:21,766
this ancient controversy

337
00:15:21,766 --> 00:15:23,833
hasn't gathered dust in libraries

338
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,366
it's erupted into a full blown modern day religious war

339
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:29,166
playing out in courtrooms

340
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:33,200
on social media and at sacred sites across India

341
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:37,766
in 2013 the Bodh Gaya Temple complex

342
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:41,200
Buddhism's holiest site became a flashpoint

343
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,200
a series of bomb blasts rocked the area

344
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,666
bringing simmering tensions to the surface

345
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,566
while the perpetrators motives were complex

346
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:52,000
the incident highlighted the fragile state of Hindu

347
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,633
Buddhist relations in India

348
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,800
the battleground has shifted to the digital realm

349
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,000
too Hindu Nationalists

350
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,966
flood Social media

351
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:02,300
with claims about Buddha's Hindu origins

352
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:06,000
Buddhist activists counter with hashtag campaigns

353
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,300
asserting their founders distinct identity

354
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:11,666
in 2015 a Twitter storm erupted

355
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,900
when a prominent Hindu leader tweeted that

356
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,900
the hashtag #BuddhaWasNotHindu trended for days

357
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,366
with Buddhists worldwide

358
00:16:21,366 --> 00:16:23,200
sharing quotes and historical facts

359
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,300
to counter the claim

360
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,200
it's a meme war

361
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,800
with profound implications for religious identity

362
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,033
legal battles rage over control

363
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,800
of ancient Buddhist sites

364
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,033
the case of Sarnath where Buddha gave his first sermon

365
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,933
saw Buddhists fighting for greater control

366
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:44,600
over the site's management

367
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,266
these aren't just squabbles over real estate

368
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,633
their struggles for historical legitimacy

369
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,066
political leaders have entered the fray

370
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,866
in 2015 India's prime minister

371
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:55,700
raised eyebrows

372
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,933
by gifting a Buddha statue to a Hindu temple

373
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:58,900
in Mongolia

374
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:01,600
was it a gesture of interfaith harmony

375
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,900
or a subtle assertion of the Avatar claim

376
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,900
the debate raged for weeks

377
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:11,200
educational curricula have become another battleground

378
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,733
controversies

379
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:15,066
erupt over how Buddha's relationship to Hinduism

380
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,766
is presented in textbooks

381
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:17,866
each side

382
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:20,300
accuses the other of trying to rewrite history

383
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,600
to fit their narrative

384
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:23,800
even international relations

385
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,500
feel the heat of this controversy

386
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:28,800
when Chinese officials claim Buddha was born in Nepal

387
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:31,700
it's not seen as a mere geographical dispute

388
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,333
it's perceived as an attempt to distance Buddha

389
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,833
from his Indian and potentially Hindu roots

390
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,266
the Dalai Lama typically a voice for interfaith harmony

391
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:43,833
has been drawn into the debate

392
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,000
the Dalai Lama once remarked

393
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:56,600
his nuanced statements on Buddha's Hindu connections

394
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,833
have been seized upon by both sides

395
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:00,966
demonstrating how even calls for unity

396
00:18:00,966 --> 00:18:03,500
can become ammunition in this ideological war

397
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:07,133
this isn't some academic debate

398
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:09,900
confined to ivory towers it's a living

399
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,200
breathing conflict

400
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,900
reshaping the religious landscape of South Asia

401
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:17,600
the questions raised by those ancient texts

402
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
are being answered in today's headlines

403
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,200
protests and policy decisions

404
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,500
and with every tweet every court case

405
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:29,200
every political speech the stakes only get higher

406
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:37,266
now brace yourselves for the mother of all plot twists

407
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,400
what if this entire controversy

408
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,866
is based on a colossal misunderstanding?

409
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:45,766
what if instead of Buddha being an Avatar of Vishnu

410
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:48,233
it was Vishnu who was influenced by Buddha?

411
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,166
let's rewind the clock

412
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,800
the earliest clear references to Buddha

413
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,300
as Vishnu's Avatar

414
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:58,433
appear centuries after Buddha's death

415
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,100
but here's the kicker they also come after Buddhism

416
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,866
had already made a significant impact

417
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:04,833
across India

418
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:08,466
some scholars argue that as Buddhism gained popularity

419
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,633
it influenced Hinduism profoundly

420
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,900
as religious scholar Wendy Doniger notes in her book

421
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:14,833
the Hindus

422
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:17,666
"Hinduism has no single founder

423
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,166
no single scripture

424
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,400
and no commonly agreed set of teachings

425
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:23,366
throughout its long history

426
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:24,333
it is woven together

427
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,633
many separate threads of belief and practice

428
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,200
including

429
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,400
some that were originally part of other traditions

430
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,500
such as Buddhism"

431
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:35,966
the concept of ahimsa or non violence?

432
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,300
it gained prominence in Hinduism after Buddhist time

433
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,333
the idea of a compassionate god

434
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,100
incarnating to teach dharma?

435
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,333
it bears a striking resemblance to

436
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,500
the Buddhist concept of the Bodhisattva

437
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,633
here's where it gets wild

438
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:52,566
what if the story of vishnus avatars

439
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,900
as we know it today was shaped by Buddhist ideas?

440
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,500
what if in an ironic twist

441
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:00,600
the claim of Buddha as Vishnu's Avatar was

442
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,900
itself influenced by Buddhist concepts?

443
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,233
this theory turns the entire debate on its head

444
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:07,766
it suggests that

445
00:20:07,766 --> 00:20:09,966
rather than Hinduism absorbing Buddhism

446
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:12,200
Buddhism may have transformed Hinduism

447
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,633
at a fundamental level

448
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,600
the Avatar of Vishnu

449
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,066
who renounces violence and teaches compassion

450
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,066
he might owe more to Buddha than we've ever realized

451
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:22,500
but it doesn't stop there

452
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:24,166
some researchers point out

453
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,366
that the worship of Vishnu

454
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:27,666
rose to prominence during the same period

455
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,866
when Buddhism was at its peak in India

456
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,200
could this be mere coincidence

457
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,000
or evidence of Buddhist influence on Vishnu's cult?

458
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,566
look at the evolution of the god Vishnu himself

459
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,066
in early Vedic texts he's a minor solar deity

460
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:45,233
but by the time of the Bhagavad Gita

461
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,500
he's a supreme god who incarnates to teach dharma

462
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:50,400
a concept strikingly similar to

463
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,233
the Buddhist idea of the Bodhisattva

464
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,066
this perspective

465
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:56,366
doesn't just challenge the Avatar claim

466
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:58,933
it rewrites the entire history of Hindu

467
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:02,600
Buddhist interactions it transforms our understanding

468
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,433
of how these two great traditions shaped each other

469
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,433
of course this theory is hotly debated

470
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:11,366
Hindu scholars argue it downplays the antiquity

471
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:13,366
and continuity of Hindu traditions

472
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,300
some Buddhists worry it might

473
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,600
undermine the uniqueness of Buddhist teachings

474
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,633
but if true it would be the ultimate irony

475
00:21:21,266 --> 00:21:24,833
the very claim meant to subsume Buddhism into Hinduism

476
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:25,700
might itself

477
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,600
be evidence of Buddhism's profound

478
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,233
impact on Hindu thought

479
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:31,400
it's not just a plot twist

480
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,000
it's a paradigm shift

481
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,533
that forces us to rethink everything we thought we

482
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:37,633
knew about the history of eastern religion

483
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,566
the fallout from this controversy

484
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:47,233
shatters our understanding of eastern spirituality

485
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,100
it forces us to confront mind bending

486
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,600
implications that reach far beyond academia

487
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,666
or theology

488
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:58,866
consider this if Buddha was indeed Vishnu's Avatar

489
00:21:58,966 --> 00:22:01,600
it would mean Buddhism isn't a separate religion

490
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:03,433
but a branch of Hinduism

491
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:06,700
this would reshape the spiritual landscape of Asia

492
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,800
overnight billions of Buddhists worldwide

493
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,733
would have to grapple with an identity crisis

494
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:14,966
of cosmic proportions on the flip side

495
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,400
if Vishnu's Avatar concept was influenced by Buddhism

496
00:22:18,566 --> 00:22:21,166
it would mean Hinduism as we know it today

497
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,500
owes a massive debt to the very tradition

498
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,966
it claims to have spawned

499
00:22:25,466 --> 00:22:27,866
it would be like finding out your parents were secretly

500
00:22:27,866 --> 00:22:29,233
your children all along

501
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,033
but the implications go deeper

502
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:34,900
this controversy

503
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,666
challenges our very notion of religious boundaries

504
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,900
if two of the world's major religions

505
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,100
are this intertwined

506
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,233
can we truly draw clear lines between any faiths?

507
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:45,333
it raises

508
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,233
profound questions about the nature of spiritual truth

509
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,700
can contradictory beliefs both be true in some sense?

510
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:53,733
or does the truth of one tradition

511
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:55,466
necessarily negate the other

512
00:22:56,566 --> 00:22:59,900
the political ramifications are explosive

513
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:03,933
in India where religious identity

514
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:06,100
often intertwines with politics

515
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:08,700
this debate could reshape power structures

516
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,266
and social hierarchies

517
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,100
it could fuel movements for religious reform

518
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,500
or spark reactionary backlashes

519
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,866
for interfaith dialogue

520
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:21,300
this controversy is both a challenge and an opportunity

521
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:23,966
it demonstrates the pitfalls of simplistic

522
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:25,633
attempts at religious harmony

523
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,966
but it also reveals the deep

524
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:29,066
often surprising

525
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:31,433
connections between traditions that seem opposed

526
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:33,533
on a personal level

527
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:38,500
it forces believers to confront uncomfortable questions

528
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,666
what does it mean to follow a spiritual path

529
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,266
if its origins are uncertain?

530
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:45,700
how much does historical truth matter

531
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,833
and matters of faith?

532
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,000
for scholars this debate opens new avenues of research

533
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:54,100
it demands a reevaluation of ancient texts

534
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,800
a reinterpretation of archaeological evidence

535
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,500
and a new

536
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,833
approach to understanding religious evolution

537
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,766
ultimately this controversy does more than

538
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:04,233
rewrite religious history

539
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:07,333
it challenges us to rethink the very nature of religion

540
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,166
itself

541
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:11,666
it suggests that our spiritual traditions aren't fixed

542
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,866
unchanging entities but dynamic

543
00:24:14,866 --> 00:24:17,766
interacting and evolving systems of thought

544
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,566
in the end whether Buddha was Vishnu's Avatar

545
00:24:21,566 --> 00:24:23,600
or Vishnu was influenced by Buddha

546
00:24:23,866 --> 00:24:25,033
one thing is clear

547
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:28,700
the relationship between Hinduism and Buddhism

548
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,900
is far more complex far more intimate

549
00:24:31,966 --> 00:24:34,833
and far more mind bending than we ever imagined

550
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:39,900
as we wrap up this mind bending journey

551
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,800
let's drop one final truth bomb

552
00:24:42,466 --> 00:24:44,066
the beauty of this controversy lies

553
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,466
not in picking a side but in recognizing

554
00:24:46,466 --> 00:24:48,000
the intricate dance between these two

555
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,366
profound traditions

556
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,900
remember at its core

557
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,366
Buddhism teaches the four noble truths

558
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:56,866
the truth of suffering its cause

559
00:24:56,866 --> 00:24:59,433
its end and the path to its end

560
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,900
the Buddha Siddhartha Gautama

561
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,000
taught a middle way

562
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,400
between indulgence and aestheticism

563
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:09,266
he emphasized personal responsibility

564
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,466
ethical conduct

565
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:13,066
and the cultivation of wisdom and compassion

566
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,233
whether or not Buddha was an Avatar of Vishnu

567
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:18,766
doesn't change the essence of his teachings

568
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,300
the Eightfold Path the concept of Nirvana

569
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:25,166
the emphasis on mindfulness and meditation

570
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:28,366
these remain powerful tools for personal transformation

571
00:25:28,366 --> 00:25:30,466
regardless of their historical origins

572
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:33,800
this controversy

573
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,200
reminds us that religion isn't a fixed set of beliefs

574
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:41,000
but a living breathing entity that evolves over time

575
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,200
it shows us that spiritual truths can transcend

576
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,300
the boundaries we try to draw around them

577
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,500
so here's my challenge to you

578
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,433
don't simply accept or reject the Avatar claim

579
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,066
instead use this controversy as a springboard

580
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:57,600
for deeper exploration

581
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,766
dive into the teachings of Buddha

582
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:02,366
examine the philosophy of Hinduism

583
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,466
look for

584
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:06,100
the common threads that bind these traditions together

585
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,466
and the unique insights each offers

586
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,900
question your assumptions

587
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,600
challenge your beliefs but above all

588
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,100
remember

589
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,433
that the ultimate goal of both Buddhism and Hinduism

590
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:19,200
is to alleviate suffering

591
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,266
and achieve a higher state of being

592
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,166
how you get there is less important than the journey

593
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,000
itself

594
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:30,700

595
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,866

read the original texts

597
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,200
talk to practitioners of both faiths

598
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,400
visit temples and monasteries

599
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:42,100

600
00:26:42,766 --> 00:26:45,433

604

the more we discuss these ideas

605
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:55,933
the closer we get to understanding

606
00:26:55,933 --> 00:26:58,300
not just Buddhism and Hinduism

607
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,300
but the very nature of spirituality itself

608
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:04,633
remember in the words often attributed to Buddha

609
00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:22,900
so what do you think? is Buddha an Avatar of Vishnu?

610
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,900
is Vishnu influenced by Buddha?

611
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,366
or is the truth something else entirely?
