3
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:11,599
coaster of experiences that often leave

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:14,280

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,480

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,039
seem to attract success and happiness

While others struggle through one

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,000
obstacle after another the answer to

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,640
this mystery May lie in the ancient

[Music]

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,240
at its core karma is the law of cause

37
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,000
and effect it's the universal principle

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,079
that governs the consequences of our

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,920
actions words and even our thoughts the

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,520
term Karma comes from the Sanskrit root

41
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,560
cre which means to

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,000
do so quite literally karma is the

eight-fold

48
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,759
path the Buddha taught that our actions

49
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,000
have consequences that extend far beyond

50
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,200
our current lifetime this is where the

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,080
concept of rebirth comes into play but

52
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,640
don't worry we'll save the juicy details

53
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,120
of rebirth for another

54
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,239
video according to Buddhist teachings

55
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,480
our Karma determines the nature of our

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,599
rebirth positive Karma leads to a

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,560
favorable rebirth while negative Karma

58
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:27,480
can result in a less fortunate one this

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,080
cycle of birth death and rebirth known

60
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,760
as samsara continues until one attains

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,120
Enlightenment and breaks free from the

62
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,680
karmic

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,879
cycle think of it like this every action

64
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,640
we take is like a pebble thrown into the

65
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,599
pond of Our

66
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,040
Lives just as the pebble creates ripples

67
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,239
that spread out across the water our

68
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,400
actions create vibrations that Ripple

69
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,280
out into the world shaping our

70
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,560
experiences and the experiences of those

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:03:00,000
around us there are three types of karma

72
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,959
in Buddhist teachings San prda and crean

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,640
a

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,640
Karma San Karma refers to the

75
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,319
accumulated karma from all our past

76
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,159
actions while prda karma is the portion

77
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,640
of our past Karma that is bearing fruit

78
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:17,000
in our current life cream karma is the

79
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,319
new Karma we create through our present

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,560
actions it's important to understand

81
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:24,400
that karma is not about punishment or

82
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,560
reward it's a neutral force that simply

83
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,760
reflects our own energy back to us when

84
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,239
we act with kindness compassion and in

85
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,439
Integrity we plant the seeds of positive

86
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,920
Karma these seeds will eventually bear

87
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,120
fruit in the form of Happiness success

88
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,120
and

89
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,840
fulfillment on the other hand when we

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,080
engage in negative actions such as

91
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,159
harming others or ourselves we create

92
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,200
negative

93
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,840
Karma this negative energy will manifest

94
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,799
as obstacles challenges and suffering in

95
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,959
our

96
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,879
lives the Buddha taught that the way to

97
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,519
free ourselves from negative karmic

98
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,159
patterns is through the practice of the

99
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:09,040

concentration the beauty of karma is

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,400
that it empowers us to take control of

106
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,880
Our Lives by becoming mindful of our

107
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,639
actions and their consequences we can

108
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,759
consciously choose to create a more

109
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,800
positive reality for ourselves and those

110
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,880
those around us as the Buddha said we

111
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,280
are what we think all that we are arises

112
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,680
with our thoughts with our thoughts we

113
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,680
make the

114
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,440
world now that we've explored the

115
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,400
concept of Karma let's take a look at

116
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,400
how it manifests in our daily lives

117
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,400
karma is not some abstract idea it's a

118
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,800
living breathing force that shapes our

119
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,880
exper experiences and interactions with

120
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,039
the world around us every action we take

121
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,240
no matter how small has the power to

122
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,240
create ripples of positive or negative

123
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,120
energy imagine you're walking down the

124
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,080
street and you see an elderly person

125
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,039
struggling to carry their

126
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,759
groceries in that moment you have a

127
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,440
choice you can walk by and ignore their

128
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,080
struggle or you can stop and offer to

129
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,960
help by choosing to act with kindness

130
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,360
and compassion you're not only making a

131
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,440
difference in that person's day but

132
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,000
you're also planting a seed of positive

133
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,120
Karma these small acts of kindness may

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,360
seem insignificant but they have the

135
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,800
power to create a ripple effect of

136
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,600
positivity when we experience kindness

137
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,319
from others we are more likely to pay it

138
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,440
forward and spread that positivity to

139
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,639
those around

140
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,319
us in this way our positive actions can

141
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,280
create a chain reaction action of Good

142
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,600
Will that extends far beyond our

143
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,759
immediate circle of

144
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,759
influence in Buddhist teachings there's

145
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,639
a famous story that illustrates the

146
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,639
power of karma in action The Story Goes

147
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,840
that the Buddha was once insulted by a

148
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:19,080
man named

149
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:23,479
akosa despite the man's harsh words the

150
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,479
Buddha remained calm and responded with

151
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,639
compassion when aosen saw that his

152
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,360
insults had no effect he was puzzled and

153
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,280
asked the Buddha why he didn't react

154
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,759
with anger the Buddha replied if someone

155
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,440
offers you a gift and you decline to

156
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,479
accept it to whom does the gift

157
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,840
belong aosen realized that by refusing

158
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,360
to react with anger the Buddha was

159
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,520
simply returning the man's negative

160
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,720
energy back to him this story teaches us

161
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,680
that we have a choice in how we respond

162
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,680
to the world around

163
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,720
us when we're faced with negativity or

164
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,960
adversity we can choose to react with

165
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,720
anger and aggression or we can choose to

166
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,120
respond with compassion and

167
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,800
understanding by cultivating mindfulness

168
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,199
and emotional regulation through

169
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,639
practices like

170
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,039
meditation we can develop the skillful

171
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,199
means to navigate life's challenges with

172
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,879
Grace and

173
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,160
Equanimity on the flip side when we

174
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,280
engage in negative actions such as

175
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,840
speaking ill of others or acting out of

176
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,240
selfishness we create negative

177
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,440
Karma these actions May provide a

178
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,039
temporary sense of satisfaction or power

179
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,680
but ultimately they plant seeds of

180
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,759
Discord and suffering that will come

181
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,759
back to haunt us in the

182
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,879
future another powerful example of karma

183
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,319
in action can be found in the story of

184
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,840
angulam

185
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,479
Mala you might remember the powerful

186
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,520
story of the notorious murderer who was

187
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,440
reformed by the

188
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,759
Buddha Matt actually covered this story

189
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,960
in depth in a previous video which you

190
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,680
can check out by clicking the link

191
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:14,720
above but to recap despite angulam

192
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,280
mala's heinous crimes the Buddha saw the

193
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,800
potential for goodness within him and

194
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,360
reached out with

195
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,680
compassion through the Buddha's guidance

196
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,520
angulimala was able to transform his

197
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,560
negative Karma and find

198
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,599
Redemption the key to harnessing the

199
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,880
power of karma is

200
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,760
mindfulness by becoming more aware of

201
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,000
our thoughts words and deeds we can

202
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,399
consciously choose to align our actions

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,120
with our highest values and

204
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,880
aspirations this doesn't mean we'll

205
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,600
always get it right we're human after

206
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,680
all but by setting a positive intention

207
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,959
and making a sincere effort to live with

208
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,959
Integrity we can gradually shift the

209
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,959
balance of our karma in a more positive

210
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:03,399
direction remember karma is not about

211
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,839
Perfection it's about

212
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,839
progress every moment presents an

213
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,160
opportunity to make a choice a choice to

214
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:14,279
act with kindness compassion and wisdom

215
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,880
by embracing these choices and being

216
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:19,079
mindful of the seeds we planting we can

217
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,920
create a more positive and fulfilling

218
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:23,920
reality for ourselves and those around

219
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,279
us as we've seen karma is a power power

220
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,360
ful force that shapes our experiences

221
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,640
and interactions with the world around

222
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,680
us but to truly harness the

223
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,640
transformative potential of karma it's

224
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,959
important to understand its deeper

225
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,920
nature and how it operates on a

226
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,440
fundamental level and Buddhist

227
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,600
philosophy karma is often described as a

228
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,240
neutral Force like a mirror that simply

229
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,440
reflects our own energy back to us just

230
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,440
as a mirror doesn't judge or

231
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,399
discriminate Karma doesn't have an

232
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,160
agenda or a moral bias it simply

233
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,399
responds to the energy we put out into

234
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,519
the world whether that energy is

235
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,519
positive or negative so if you find

236
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,079
yourself experiencing a lot of negative

237
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,720
Karma it might be time to take a good

238
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,160
long look in the

239
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,240
mirror of course cultivating these

240
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,839
positive qualities is easier said than

241
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,640
done it requires a commitment to

242
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,240
self-reflection personal growth and

243
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,240
spiritual

244
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,440
practice this neutral quality of karma

245
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,000
is important to understand because it it

246
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,959
means that we are ultimately responsible

247
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,279
for our own experiences we can't blame

248
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,440
others or external circumstances for the

249
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,519
challenges we face in life instead we

250
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,160
must look within and take ownership of

251
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,440
the seeds we've planted through our

252
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,880
thoughts words and

253
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,480
actions another key aspect of karma is

254
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,839
the idea of seeds and

255
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,800
fruits every action we take plants a

256
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,279
seed in the garden of our mind and these

257
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:05,200
seeds will eventually bear fruit in the

258
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:07,440
form of our experiences and

259
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,480
circumstances some seeds May sprout

260
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,959
quickly While others may lay dormant for

261
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,839
years or even lifetimes before they

262
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:17,440
ripen this idea of seeds and fruits is

263
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,639
beautifully Illustrated in the dapada

264
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,079
one of the most beloved texts in

265
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:25,959
Buddhist literature in it the Buddha

266
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:28,240
says the kind of seed sewn will produce

267
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:30,360
that kind of fruit those who do good

268
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,240
will reap good results those who do evil

269
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,120
will reap evil results if you carefully

270
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,720
plant a good seed you will joyfully

271
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,720
gather good

272
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,680
fruit in Buddhist teachings it's

273
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,200
believed that karma is stored in our

274
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,000
mind or Consciousness which Carries On

275
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,800
from One Life to the next this means

276
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,360
that even if we don't see the immediate

277
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,440
consequences of our actions the seeds we

278
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,279
plant will eventually come to fruition

279
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,240
whether in this life or a future one one

280
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:05,120
the transformative power of karma is

281
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,959
exemplified in the story of King Ashoka

282
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,240
one of the greatest rulers in Indian

283
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,279
history before his conversion to

284
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,720
Buddhism Ashoka was known as a ruthless

285
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:16,560
and violent conqueror but after

286
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,880
witnessing the devastation of his own

287
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,199
actions Ashoka had a profound change of

288
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,440
heart he embraced the teachings of the

289
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:25,519
Buddha and dedicated the rest of his

290
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,160
life to spreading the Dharma and

291
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,199
promoting peace and compassion

292
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:33,040
throughout his Empire a J's story

293
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:35,839
illustrates another important aspect to

294
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,240
Karma the idea of

295
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,519
purification just as a lotus flower

296
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,399
emerges pure and beautiful From the

297
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:47,800
Muddy Waters of a pond we too have the

298
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,240
capacity to transform our negative Karma

299
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,959
and rise above our past

300
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,120
actions through sincere practice and a

301
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,480
commitment to ethical living we can

302
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,720
purify our minds and create a brighter

303
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,440
future for ourselves and others the

304
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,839
Buddha's words remind us that our

305
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,959
actions have consequences that extend

306
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,639
far beyond the present

307
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:13,440
moment the seeds we plant today will

308
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,079
shape the landscape of our future

309
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,079
experiences just as the seeds we planted

310
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,800
in the past have shaped our current

311
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,800
reality so how can we plant more

312
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,560
positive seeds and create a brighter

313
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,240
future for ourselves and others the

314
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,160
Buddha taught that the key is to

315
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,839
cultivate wholesome qualities like

316
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,440
generosity compassion loving kindness

317
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,199
and wisdom by aligning our actions with

318
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,959
these qualities we plant seeds of

319
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:41,079
positivity that will bear fruit in the

320
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:43,519
form of Happiness success and

321
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:45,600
fulfillment of course cultivating these

322
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,199
positive qualities is easier said than

323
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,000
done it requires a commitment to

324
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:52,120
self-reflection personal growth and

325
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,320
spiritual

326
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,360
practice but the good news is that every

327
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,360
moment presents a new opportunity to

328
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,440
plant a positive seed and steer our

329
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,639
karma in a more wholesome direction as

330
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,920
we deepen our understanding of karma we

331
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,600
begin to see that it's not some abstract

332
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,839
concept or esoteric belief system it's a

333
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,160
practical tool for understanding the

334
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,000
interconnectedness of our actions and

335
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,320
experiences and for taking

336
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,360
responsibility for the direction of Our

337
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,639
Lives by embracing the wisdom of Karma

338
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,880
and cultivating a mindful compassionate

339
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,959
approach to life we can transform our

340
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,880
suffering into Joy Joy our challenges

341
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,600
into

342
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,440
opportunities and our fear into faith

343
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,320
and in doing so we not only create a

344
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,079
brighter future for ourselves but also

345
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,000
contribute to the healing and Awakening

346
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:46,519
of the world around us the Buddha taught

347
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,440
that the laws of karma are inescapable

348
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,279
no matter who we are or where we come

349
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,040
from we are all subject to the universal

350
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,720
law of cause and effect but here's the

351
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:00,759
good news we also have the power of Free

352
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,360
Will in every moment we have the ability

353
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:06,040
to choose our actions and shape our own

354
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,560
destiny by aligning our choices with the

355
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:12,320
highest qualities of the human Spirit

beings now that we have a deeper

362
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,360
understanding of Karma and how it

363
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,199
operates let's explore some practical

364
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,399
ways we can cultivate positive karma in

365
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,519
our daily lives the Buddha taught that

366
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,240
the key to happiness and fulfillment

367
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,360
lies in aligning our actions with

368
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,880
wholesome qualities like generosity

369
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,240
compassion loving kindness and

370
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,360
wisdom one of the most powerful tools

371
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,519
for cultivating positive karma is the

372
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,600
practice of

373
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:57,199
mindfulness by bringing a gentle

374
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,079
non-judgmental awareness to our thoughts

375
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,079
words and actions we can begin to notice

376
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,920
the seeds we're planting in each moment

377
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,519
are we sewing seeds of kindness and

378
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,759
compassion or are we getting caught up

379
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,759
in patterns of negativity and

380
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,720
reactivity remember mindfulness is like

381
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:15,680
a karmic GPS it helps us navigate the

382
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,639
twists and turns of life with greater

383
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,120

cultivating positive karma is

386
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,560
beautifully Illustrated in the story of

387
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,240
anathapindika one of the Buddha's most

388
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,759
devoted lay followers

389
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,600
anatha penda was a wealthy Merchant who

390
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,440
was known for his incredible generosity

391
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,440
he donated a large portion of his

392
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,319
fortune to the construction of

393
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,680
monasteries and the support of the

394
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:45,240

395
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:48,560
Community the Buddha praised anatha

396
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,199
Pinda for his generosity saying that he

397
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,759
had planted seeds of Merit that would

398
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:53,759
bear fruit for lifetimes to

399
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:03,120
come another way to cultivate positive

400
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:05,520
karma is through acts of kindness and

401
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,760
compassion when we take the time to help

402
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,679
others to listen with an open heart or

403
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,679
to offer words of encouragement or

404
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,079
planting seeds of love and connection

405
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,760
that will Ripple out into the world

406
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:19,640
around us even small acts of kindness

407
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,439
like smiling at a stranger or holding

408
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,439
the door open for someone can have a

409
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,120
profound impact on both our own

410
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,960
well-being and the well-being of

411
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,840
others engaging in volunteer work and

412
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,840
community service is another powerful

413
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,400
way to cultivate positive

414
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,720
karma when we dedicate our time and

415
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,520
energy to serving others and making a

416
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,720
positive difference in the world we're

417
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,360
not only planting seeds of compassion

418
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,799
and generosity but also strengthening

419
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,360
our own sense of purpose and connection

420
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,360
to something greater than

421
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,400
ourselves it's important to remember

422
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,200
that cultivating positive Cara is not

423
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,400
about trying to earn brownie points or

424
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,960
accumulate some kind of cosmic currency

425
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,880
rather it's about aligning our actions

426
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,960
with our deepest values and aspirations

427
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,679
and trusting that the fruits of our

428
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,440
efforts will ripen in their own time

429
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:14,559
cultivating positive karma is a lifelong

430
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,760
journey one that requires patience

431
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,640
perseverance and a willingness to keep

432
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,559
showing up with an open heart but as we

433
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,039
align our actions with the highest

434
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,919
qualities of the human Spirit we

435
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:30,760
gradually transform ourselves in the

436
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,760
world around us one seed at a time

437
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,080
as we come to the end of our exploration

438
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,720
of karma I invite you to take a moment

439
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,880
to reflect on the seeds you've been

440
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,919
planting in your own life remember every

441
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,559
thought word and action has the power to

442
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,840
shape your reality and the reality of

443
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,520
those around you the Buddha taught that

444
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,320
we are all interconnected bound together

445
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,640
by the intricate web of cause and effect

446
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,440
when we harm others we harm ourselves

447
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,760
when we uplift others

448
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,000
we uplift

449
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,320
ourselves by understanding the law of

450
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,600
karma we can begin to live in Greater

451
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,440
harmony with ourselves with each other

452
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,039
and with the world around

453
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,120
us one of the most powerful ways to

454
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:17,120
cultivate positive karma is through the

455
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,240
practice of loving kindness meditation

456
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,520
by silently repeating phrases of Good

457
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,039
Will and compassion for ourselves and

458
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,679
others we plant seeds of love and

459
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,679
connection that can transform even the

460
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,679
most challenging relationships and

461
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,679
circumstances

462
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,799

463

464
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,520
final

465
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,159
teaching all conditioned things are

468
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,120
powerful reminder that the seeds we

469
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,520
