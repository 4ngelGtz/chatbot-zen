1
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,033
six months after my father died

2
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:11,200
my mother found something

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,200
hidden behind books in his study

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,200
a worn meditation cushion and a small notebook

5
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,900
my father was a practical engineer

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,800
who built bridges and calculated stress loads

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,133
he never spoke of any interest in spirituality

8
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:27,566
at least not to us yet

9
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:30,266
here were pages showing he'd been secretly studying

10
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:32,800
Buddhist teachings about consciousness and death

11
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,700
trying to understand

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,966
one tradition's vision of what might happen

13
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:38,933
after the body stops functioning

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,633
his investigation led him to Tibet's most detailed

15
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:45,200
contemplative map of the afterlife

16
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:48,433
a tradition that describes a 49-day journey

17
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:49,166
through states

18
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:52,900
where consciousness navigates self created experiences

19
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,133
before choosing its next existence

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,300
tonight we explore

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,433
what my father discovered about this Buddhist

22
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:02,000
vision of death and what it reveals

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,033
about how one ancient culture approached

24
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:05,866
humanity's deepest mystery

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,900
I'm Peter and we're about to examine

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,966
one of Buddhism's most elaborate attempts

27
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:13,100
to map what happens after we die

28
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,300
we've explored the Tibetan Book of the dead before

29
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,600
on this channel covering the six bardos

30
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,500
if you haven't seen that episode

31
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,400
watch it first for foundational understanding

32
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,400
tonight we focus specifically

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,100
on how Tibetan Buddhism

34
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,066
envisions the three post death bardos

35
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,100
their contemplative description of consciousness

36
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,366
during the 49 days after death

37
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,700
while the title might suggest universal truth

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,066
we're exploring one tradition's vision

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,333
of post death consciousness

40
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,800
not claiming it represents objective reality

41
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:50,766
different Buddhist traditions

42
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:52,566
offer completely different visions

43
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:53,466
of death

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,166
many Theravada teachers describe immediate rebirth

45
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,100
based on the final mind moment

46
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,300
pure land Buddhism

47
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:04,900
emphasizes instant transition to Amitabha's realm

48
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,466
through devotion Zen

49
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:07,066
traditions

50
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:09,400
focus on recognizing that there's ultimately

51
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,166
no permanent self to die or be reborn

52
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:17,500
Tibetan Buddhism developed one of the most elaborate

53
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,100
contemplative visions of intermediate consciousness

54
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,900
states

55
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:23,200
as contemporary Tibetan teacher

56
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,500
Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche notes

57
00:02:33,866 --> 00:02:35,266
in traditional practice

58
00:02:35,266 --> 00:02:37,500
these teachings aren't studied casually

59
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,300
they require years of preliminary training

60
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,333
under qualified lamas including 100,000 prostrations

61
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:48,966
visualization practices and devotional preparation

62
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:50,800
we are encountering them

63
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,000
outside this traditional framework

64
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,400
which offers insights

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,000
but also creates significant limitations

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,400
in our understanding

67
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:01,100
these teachings trace back to texts

68
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,900
compiled by Yeshe Tsogyal

69
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,366
and revealed by Karma Lingpa in the 14th century

70
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:09,100
preserved within Tibetan culture

71
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:11,366
for those engaging with their approach

72
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:13,533
to consciousness exploration

73
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,066
modern neuroscience

74
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:17,400
offers different perspectives on consciousness

75
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,366
and death

76
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,433
but these ancient contemplative visions

77
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:24,666
remain fascinating examples of how human cultures

78
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:27,400
have attempted to map the unmappable

79
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,633
according to Tibetan Buddhist teaching

80
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:37,266
the first phase begins at the moment of death

81
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:39,200
what they call the clear light

82
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,466
when consciousness supposedly separates from the body

83
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:45,733
The Bardo Thödol contains this instruction

84
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:53,233
a cryptic reference to consciousness

85
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,133
encountering what they consider its essential nature

86
00:03:56,666 --> 00:04:00,200
this represents the Chikhai Bardo in their framework

87
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
lasting from the moment of death

88
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,100
through roughly the first day

89
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,600
the tradition teaches that consciousness encounters

90
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,500
what they consider its own fundamental nature

91
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,200
without thoughts or emotions overlaying it

92
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,000
traditional Tibetan teachers describe this as awareness

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,100
recognizing awareness itself

94
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,766
though what this actually means

95
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:24,233
requires extensive contemplative training

96
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:25,333
to understand

97
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,666
most practitioners according to this tradition

98
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:32,900
find this overwhelming and "faint" into unconsciousness

99
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,766
missing what they consider

100
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:37,400
the ultimate liberation opportunity

101
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:40,000
then consciousness

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,933
supposedly moves into what they call the Chönyi Bardo

103
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,600
where peaceful deities begin manifesting

104
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,133
over the following days

105
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,800
Avalokiteshvara appears as overwhelming compassion

106
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,766
within this contemplative vision

107
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,433
but Tibetan Buddhism teaches

108
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,300
these aren't external beings

109
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,800
they represent consciousness

110
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,966
meeting its own unlimited capacities in symbolic form

111
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:06,300
if consciousness doesn't recognize

112
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,833
the peaceful manifestations

113
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,500
as its own projections according to this teaching

114
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:14,333
they begin appearing in wrathful forms

115
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,266
Yamantaka manifests as a terrifying destroyer figure

116
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:20,500
representing what the tradition sees

117
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,433
as wisdom's power to eliminate the illusion

118
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:25,100
of permanent selfhood

119
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,666
whether these deity encounters represent literal

120
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,266
post death experiences

121
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:34,433
or sophisticated psychological symbolism

122
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:36,666
developed within Tibetan culture

123
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:39,333
cannot be determined from our position

124
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,766
but they reveal remarkable

125
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:44,566
contemplative creativity in approaching death

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,466
have you ever wondered what it would mean to recognize

127
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:49,733
awareness itself

128
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,866
not thoughts or emotions

129
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,900
but the knowing quality that observes them

130
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,100
the phase that most challenges our understanding

131
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,033
comes in what Tibetan Buddhism calls

132
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:07,000
the Sidpa Bardo the Bardo of becoming

133
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:11,100
supposedly lasting from day 15 through day 49

134
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:13,566
according to this tradition

135
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:16,300
consciousness creates experienced reality

136
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,300
through thought and emotion

137
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
during this phase though

138
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,266
this obviously

139
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:24,366
represents claims beyond current verification

140
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,166
let me pause here

141
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,000
because this is where my father's engineering mind

142
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,066
really struggled with these teachings

143
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:35,366
during his final month

144
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:37,500
instead of avoiding talk about dying

145
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:39,466
he began asking his doctors

146
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:42,166
detailed questions about the dying process

147
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:43,900
he started meditating daily

148
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,833
and told my mother he felt curious

149
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,733
rather than terrified about what came next

150
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,033
his notebook showed attempts to understand

151
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:53,166
these reality creation claims

152
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:09,100
according to their psychology

153
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,300
every action word

154
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,600
and thought creates karmic imprints

155
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,500
stored in consciousness

156
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:17,966
during this phase these patterns

157
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:21,166
supposedly activate and project as experiences

158
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:24,533
the tradition describes several categories

159
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,466
life review not judgment by external beings

160
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:31,600
but the natural consequences of actions playing out

161
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,600
emotional environments their teaching claims

162
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,266
emotional states generate corresponding realms

163
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,900
anger creating hell realms of conflict

164
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,000
love manifesting pure lands of beauty

165
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,100
confusion generating shifting landscapes

166
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,066
whether this literally occurs after death

167
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:51,533
cannot be verified

168
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,466
but the tradition developed these descriptions

169
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:57,200
through centuries of contemplative investigation

170
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,133
within their cultural framework

171
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,466
he realized these teachings

172
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:04,266
weren't asking him to believe specific

173
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:05,733
post death scenarios

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,466
but to understand consciousness as more creative

175
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:10,500
and malleable than he'd assumed

176
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,000
this shift transformed his final weeks

177
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,833
approaching death as a transition

178
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,200
requiring awareness

179
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:18,600
rather than something to simply endure

180
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:26,800
the final stage in Tibetan Buddhist teaching

181
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,033
involves consciousness

182
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:30,133
approaching six colored doorways

183
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,833
each

184
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,600
supposedly leading to different realms of existence

185
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:36,500
traditional texts describe

186
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,666
this moment with characteristic symbolic language

187
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:43,266
but the psychological insights within this framework

188
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:46,300
offer interesting perspectives on human motivation

189
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,100
patterns

190
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:50,633
according to their tradition

191
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:54,000
though color realm associations vary significantly

192
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,300
across different Tibetan lineages

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,100
white light supposedly leads to god

194
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,866
realms of pleasure and comfort

195
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:05,600
yellow light opens to demigod

196
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,700
realms of competition and power

197
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,000
red light attracts to hungry ghost

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,900
realms of insatiable craving

199
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,266
green light leads to animal

200
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:18,000
realms of instinctual existence

201
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,466
blue light offers human realms

202
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:22,266
balancing pleasure and pain

203
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,200
smoky gray light leads to hell

204
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,766
realms of intense suffering

205
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,000
what stands out here isn't whether consciousness

206
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,533
literally chooses post death destinations

207
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,066
but how this framework maps different ways

208
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:39,600
awareness can organize experience

209
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,266
based on dominant psychological patterns

210
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:46,000
do you typically choose comfort over growth

211
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,466
competition over cooperation

212
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,700
wanting over appreciation

213
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,100
the tradition teaches that these same patterns

214
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,766
supposedly determine post death attraction

215
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:58,733
but more immediately

216
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:02,133
we can observe how they operate in daily choices

217
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,700
understanding these specific teachings suggests

218
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,266
three unique practices clear light

219
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:09,800
practice

220
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,900
daily awareness of the moment between sleep and waking

221
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,866
when consciousness transitions between states

222
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:20,766
projection practice recognizing when emotional states

223
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:23,266
create entire narratives about situations

224
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:26,266
noticing the difference between what's happening

225
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,966
and the story you're creating about it

226
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:31,500
attraction practice during stress

227
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:31,866
notice

228
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:35,066
which of the six psychological realms you default to

229
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,500
comfort seeking competition craving confusion

230
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,400
balanced awareness or suffering

231
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:50,100
my father never solved every question in his notebook

232
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,500
but his search taught me something crucial

233
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,100
about approaching mystery

234
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,566
he'd written near the end

235
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:11,733
during his final week something remarkable happened

236
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:14,166
after learning about the clear light teaching

237
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,100
he started paying

238
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,900
attention to the moment between sleep and waking

239
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:21,666
saying it felt like practice for the big transition

240
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:24,566
but I need to be honest some days

241
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:25,700
I convinced myself

242
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,133
these teachings had genuinely helped him

243
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,033
other days

244
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:31,600
I worried I was romanticizing his final months

245
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,200
to avoid facing the randomness of death

246
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:38,866
instead of the anxiety and denial we'd expected

247
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,066
he demonstrated genuine curiosity

248
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,666
about the dying process

249
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,500
he asked to have the Bardo Thodol read to him

250
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
not because he believed it literally

251
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,633
but because he found the contemplative framework

252
00:11:50,633 --> 00:11:53,700
helpful for maintaining awareness during transition

253
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,600
when pain medications made him confused

254
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,300
he would practice the simple recognition of awareness

255
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,133
itself

256
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:05,066
the same principle these death teachings emphasize

257
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,366
his approach to dying changed completely

258
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:10,200
from something happening to him

259
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,200
to something he could participate in consciously

260
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:17,100
these teachings represent Tibetan

261
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,900
Buddhism's attempt to provide detailed guidance

262
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,933
for navigating death consciously

263
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,033
developed within their specific

264
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:25,900
cultural and religious context

265
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,266
over many centuries

266
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:30,800
whether consciousness actually continues after death

267
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,066
in the ways these teachings describe

268
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,900
remains beyond current verification

269
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,700
but their frameworks

270
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,600
offer sophisticated approaches to mortality

271
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:44,266
that emphasize awareness rather than denial

272
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,600
the practices didn't eliminate grief

273
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,300
they gave me a framework for working with it

274
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,333
consciously instead of being completely overwhelmed

275
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,700
years later

276
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,500
I still don't know if his transformation was genuine

277
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,733
spiritual insight or psychological coping mechanism

278
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,966
maybe both

279
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,266
3 breath practice from the 49 day tradition

280
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,500
take three slow breaths

281
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,566
between each breath

282
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:17,066
notice the brief pause where no thought is present

283
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,900
according to this tradition

284
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,066
that pause represents the same awareness

285
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:24,100
these death teachings point toward

286
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,466
consciousness

287
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:29,166
recognizing its own nature without mental overlay

288
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,233
we've explored Tibetan

289
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:39,100
Buddhism's most detailed vision of your consciousness

290
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,500
after death from day one's clear light recognition

291
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,533
through days two to fourteen's deity encounters

292
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,300
to days 15 to 49's reality

293
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,766
creation and rebirth selection

294
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,300
these teachings represent

295
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,300
one tradition's elaborate attempt

296
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,666
to map what remains unmappable

297
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,900
developed through centuries of contemplative

298
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,333
investigation within their cultural framework

299
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,766
my father's search reminded me that approaching

300
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:10,366
ultimate questions with honest curiosity

301
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,700
can transform how we live

302
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,066
even without definitive answers

303
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,933
about what happens after death

304
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,600
science may describe consciousness as brain events

305
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,100
but Tibet frame them as awareness maps

306
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,566
for navigating the ultimate transition

307
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,366
each approach offers different insights

308
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:31,366
into the mystery of what we are

309
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:33,800
this is how Tibetan Buddhism explains

310
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,966
your consciousness after death

311
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:39,066
a 49 day journey through recognition

312
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,866
projection and choice

313
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:45,466
but here's where our exploration takes an unexpected

314
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:46,266
turn

315
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,600
these Tibetan teachings describe your consciousness

316
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,000
transforming over 49 days after death

317
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,666
what if similar death and renewal processes happen

318
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,366
continuously in daily life

319
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,433
what if you're already navigating

320
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,800
micro versions of these same transitions every moment

321
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:09,833
next week we'll explore why you've died 1,000 times

322
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,266
and how every cell in your body

323
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:14,000
undergoes constant death and regeneration

324
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:17,566
how your consciousness dissolves and recreates itself

325
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:20,700
moment by moment how understanding micro deaths

326
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,400
transforms your relationship with macro death

327
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:25,366
what we'll discover

328
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:28,300
suggest that these ancient insights about transition

329
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,366
and renewal apply to processes happening continuously

330
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:33,566
throughout life

331
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,666
making death less foreign and more familiar

332
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:38,533
than you typically imagine

333
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,466
if tonight's exploration sparked your curiosity

334
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:46,100

339

which aspect of the Tibetan vision most intrigues you

340
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:05,333
have you noticed attraction patterns

341
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:06,833
similar to the Six Realms

342
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,800
operating in your own experience

343
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,633
remember while we can't verify

344
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:14,800
claims about post death consciousness

345
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,566
we can learn from how contemplative traditions

346
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:19,566
have approached these ultimate questions

347
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,266
with sophisticated frameworks developed over centuries

348
00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:28,533
until next time stay curious stay wise
