1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,333
a Greek soldier stands before a naked monk

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,083
the monk doesn't move doesn't speak

3
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,208
the soldier drops his sword

4
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,916
this moment changed the world and nobody saw it coming

5
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,916
2300 years ago Greek warriors laid down their weapons

6
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,416
to become Buddhist monks

7
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:40,208
their story vanished from history until now

8
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:48,916
what's up wisdom seekers

9
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,666
Matt here from Buddha's Wisdom

10
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,208
man this story is like finding out

11
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,500
your strict math teacher used to be a rock star

12
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,458
imagine this Greek warriors

13
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,833
you know the tough guys with abs and spears

14
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,500
dropping their weapons to become Buddhist monks

15
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,833
talk about a career change right?

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,666
seriously this story is wild

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,625
Greek warriors ditching their weapons to become monks?

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,708
Greek kings bowing to Buddha?

19
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:17,333
and the craziest part Greeks actually created

20
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,250
the first Buddha statues ever made

21
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,250
yeah you heard that right

22
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,166
Buddhist temples across Asia

23
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,541
are packed with Greek secrets

24
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:27,958
hiding in plain sight Greek faces in ancient carvings

25
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:30,041
Greek designs and temple pillars

26
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,541
even Greek words written in Buddhist text

27
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,833
and nobody noticed for centuries

28
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,166
from lost kingdoms to hidden monasteries

29
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,083
from warrior kings to wandering philosophers

30
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:44,083
this is one of history's greatest untold stories

31
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:47,333
among these Greeks who changed Buddhism forever

32
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,208
was Pyrrho a soldier

33
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,250
who returned to Greece with revolutionary ideas

34
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,458
that still influence philosophy today

35
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,291
the year is 326 BCE

36
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,375
Alexander's army reaches India's borders

37
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,916
they're about to discover something

38
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,625
more powerful than any weapon

39
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,208
these Greek warriors had conquered the known world

40
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,250
from Macedonia through Persia

41
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,416
their 40,000 strong army seemed unstoppable

42
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,875
their swords carved through armies

43
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,083
their shields broke enemy lines

44
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,916
nothing could stop them

45
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,833
until they met men who owned nothing

46
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,375
not even clothes

47
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,416
the Greeks called them Gymnosophists

48
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,333
the naked philosophers

49
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,416
yeah you heard that right

50
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,458
Alexander soldiers didn't know whether to take notes

51
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,000
or offer them a blanket

52
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,291
in the forest near Taxila

53
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,083
these Buddhist monks sat in meditation for days

54
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,625
they felt no pain they feared nothing

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,541
Alexander's soldiers watched

56
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,833
as one monk pressed a hot iron to his skin

57
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,000
without flinching

58
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,541
another stood on one leg from sunrise to sunset

59
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,250
these weren't mere tricks

60
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,666
they were demonstrations of complete mastery

61
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,041
over body and mind

62
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,333
one monk Dandamis

63
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,041
refused Alexander's invitation to join his court

64
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,541
when threatened with death

65
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,541
he replied

66
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,916
the Greeks documented these encounters in detail

67
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,208
Onesicritus Alexander's captain

68
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,000
wrote about a monk named Calanus

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,458
who drew a line in the dirt

70
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,333
see this line he said

71
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:42,125
this is human life I can erase parts of it

72
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,958
move it around but the line stays a line

73
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,291
just like your conquests you move borders

74
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,916
claim territories but life remains life

75
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,250
some soldiers dismiss these monks as mad men

76
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,166
but others saw deeper wisdom

77
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,958
they noticed how these monks lived without fear

78
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,583
without anxiety without the constant desire for more

79
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,541
in their simplicity

80
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,500
they found something Alexander's gold couldn't buy

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,208
among Alexander's men one soldier

82
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,125
would become the living bridge between Greek

83
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,958
and Buddhist thought his name was Pyrrho

84
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,000
before India he was a painter

85
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,791
an artist turned warrior but what he saw in India

86
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,208
transformed him into something else entirely

87
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,333
according to ancient accounts

88
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,416
Pyrrho spent 18 months with these monks

89
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,291
studying their practices

90
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,375
his student Timon wrote that

91
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,833
what fascinated Pyrrho most was the Buddhist idea

92
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,375
that our opinions not external things

93
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,958
cause our suffering when Pyrrho returned to Greece

94
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,750
stories about him spread quickly

95
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:47,791
some claimed

96
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,125
he became so detached from worldly concerns

97
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,083
that he'd ignore approaching wagons

98
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,375
though his student Timon

99
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,958
probably exaggerated these tales to make a point

100
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,625
what's certain is

101
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,583
that Pyrrho brought back

102
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,958
ideas that would transform Greek philosophy

103
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,083
he founded a new school of thought

104
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,708
that questioned everything

105
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,958
even the act of questioning itself

106
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,958
why do you act like this? they asked

107
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:17,166
because nothing is inherently good or bad

108
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,625
he answered

109
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,708
our judgments make it so

110
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,791
in Greece Pyrrho founded a new school of philosophy

111
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,375
that merged Greek and Buddhist insights

112
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:29,833
from Buddhism

113
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,333
he took the idea that attachment to fixed views

114
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,375
causes suffering from Greek tradition

115
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,333
he kept the systematic questioning of all beliefs

116
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,750
the result was Greek skepticism

117
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,541
a new philosophy that taught peace

118
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,000
through suspending judgment

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,541
and accepting uncertainty

120
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,541
his students called it

121
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,125
"following the Buddha in Greek clothes"

122
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,250
in their military camps

123
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,875
Greek soldiers began debating these ideas

124
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,625
if true power meant mastery over oneself

125
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,250
rather than others what was the point of conquest

126
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,041
if happiness came from wanting nothing

127
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,250
why were they fighting for wealth and glory

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,708
these questions spread through the army like wildfire

129
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,250
some soldiers requested to stay behind in India

130
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,625
others began practicing meditation in their tents

131
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,291
even Alexander himself

132
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,041
spent hours questioning these monks about life

133
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,541
death and the nature of the soul

134
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,500
but this was just the beginning

135
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,000
as more Greeks crossed into India

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,541
as kingdoms rose and cultures merged

137
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,250
something even more remarkable was about to happen

138
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,666
the Greeks were about to transform Buddhism itself

139
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,416
the philosophical clash was immediate and profound

140
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,583
these weren't just strange aesthetics

141
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,125
they were sophisticated thinkers

142
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,500
who challenged everything the Greeks believed

143
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:52,875
this was happening

144
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,041
at a crucial moment in Indian history

145
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,833
the Mauryan Empire was rising

146
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:01,000
King Chandragupta who would unite most of India

147
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,083
watched these exchanges with interest

148
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,375
his court was a melting pot of Greek ambassadors

149
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,916
Buddhist monks and Hindu priests

150
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,375
his grandson Ashoka

151
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,000
would later become Buddhism's greatest patron

152
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,000
Alexander scribes wrote

153
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,541
frantically recording every detail

154
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,958
the monks wouldn't move if a wild animal approached

155
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,458
they slept on bare ground in winter

156
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,333
they fasted for weeks

157
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,875
but what shocked the Greeks most

158
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,500
wasn't their physical feats

159
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,333
it was their arguments

160
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,791
in the city of Taxila a great center of learning

161
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,708
Greek philosophers met Buddhist masters daily

162
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,541
this wasn't just casual exchange

163
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,041
it was a clash of civilizations

164
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,875
Greek logic met Buddhist emptiness

165
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,208
Aristotles physics faced Buddhist impermanence

166
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:51,791
the debates

167
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,083
were recorded on palm leaves and copper plates

168
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,708
some surviving to this day

169
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,666
the Greeks prided themselves on their debates

170
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,500
their philosophical schools had shaped empires

171
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:02,833
but these Buddhist monks

172
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,416
had a different way of thinking

173
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:08,000
in Athens philosophers built complex arguments

174
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,708
in Taxila monks demolished them with simple questions

175
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,666
a Greek philosopher challenged a monk

176
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,375
about the nature of reality

177
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,375
at Taxila's great university

178
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,416
pressed the Greek

179
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,041
the monk smiled

180
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,750
this exchange happened during a crucial period

181
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,833
Greek settlements were growing in Bactria and Gandhara

182
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,750
trade routes connected Athens to Pataliputra

183
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,750
Greek coins circulated alongside Indian ones

184
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,250
Greek theatre influenced Indian drama

185
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:53,083
and slowly Buddhist ideas were traveling west

186
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,791
while Greek art moved east

187
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,916
the naked truth these monks taught

188
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,916
was simple but revolutionary

189
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,583
the source of human suffering isn't in

190
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,708
the world around us it's in our own minds

191
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,541
for Greeks trained to conquer the world

192
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,000
this idea turned everything upside down

193
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,875
it would influence generations of Greek thinkers

194
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,208
from the Skeptics to the Neo-Platonists

195
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,750
but the greatest transformation was yet to come

196
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,333
as Alexander's empire fractured

197
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,208
something unprecedented emerged in Central Asia

198
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:33,375
the Indo Greek kingdom Greek rulers who spoke Sanskrit

199
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,916
Greek cities with Buddhist stupas

200
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,625
a fusion of worlds no one could have predicted

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,250
this remarkable kingdom flourished from 180 BCE

202
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,041
to 10 CE

203
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,291
for nearly two centuries

204
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,541
Greek kings ruled Buddhist lands

205
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:49,958
creating history's first

206
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,833
deliberate fusion of European and Indian cultures

207
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,041
at its peak under King Manander

208
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,875
around 150 BCE

209
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,125
the kingdom stretched from modern Afghanistan

210
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,500
through Pakistan into northern India

211
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,208
this wasn't just a military empire

212
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,250
it was a cultural revolution

213
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,125
the evidence lies buried in ancient cities

214
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,291
across Afghanistan and Pakistan

215
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,250
at Ai-Khanoum archaeologists uncovered a Greek gymnasium

216
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,791
next to Indian shrines

217
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,625
delicate Greek pottery sits beside Buddhist relics

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,583
stone inscriptions switch between Greek and Aramaic

219
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,583
then Sanskrit and Prakrit

220
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,458
sometimes in the same sentence

221
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,708
the city itself tells the story of this fusion

222
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:34,250
Greek columns line streets leading to Buddhist stupas

223
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:35,958
in one building

224
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,291
researchers found a treasury with Greek coins

225
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,083
alongside Indian jewelry

226
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,708
a stone block bears inscription of Delphic maxims

227
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,583
in pure Greek while nearby

228
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,250
Buddhist texts were written on palm leaves

229
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,333
in Greek letters

230
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,791
at its hearts to King Manander

231
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,083
known to Indians as Milinda

232
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,333
his kingdom stretched from Afghanistan to India

233
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,833
and the archaeological footprint is massive

234
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,083
his coins have been found from Central Asia to Bengal

235
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,041
some show him as a Greek warrior

236
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,166
others as a Buddhist devotee

237
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,083
one remarkable coin

238
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,166
shows the first ever image of a Greek king

239
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,500
in the lotus position

240
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,416
imagine being such a powerful king

241
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,208
that you could have anything you want

242
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,875
and you choose ... philosophy homework

243
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,458
that's like winning the lottery

244
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,000
and buying a library card

245
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,583
but Manander was built different

246
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,208
the Milinda Panha records his famous dialogues

247
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,958
with the monk Nagasena

248
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,250
these weren't just philosophical discussions

249
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,000
they were the blueprint for a new kind of kingdom

250
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,333
archaeological findings support these texts

251
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,750
Buddhist monasteries with Greek architectural elements

252
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,541
meditation halls with Greek style theaters attached

253
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,458
in Taxila

254
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,833
recent excavations revealed something extraordinary

255
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,166
a Greek temple converted into a Buddhist monastery

256
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,541
the lower layers show typical Greek architecture

257
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,500
but as you move up Buddhist elements appear

258
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,958
it's like watching cultural fusion happen

259
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,208
in layers of stone

260
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,416
the discoveries keep coming

261
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,583
in Bamiyan before the giant Buddhas were destroyed

262
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,458
researchers found traces of Greek

263
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,083
pigments in the original paint

264
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,041
in Hadda they uncovered thousands of sculptures

265
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,083
showing Buddha with the face of Apollo

266
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,541
at Begram Greek style glassworks were found

267
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,833
alongside Indian ivory carvings

268
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,083
but perhaps most telling are the ordinary objects

269
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,875
a clay lamp with Hercules on one side

270
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,250
and Buddha on the other

271
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,625
a child's toy showing a Greek soldier in meditation

272
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:36,416
pose

273
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,875
kitchen pottery with Greek patterns

274
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,958
but Indian cooking residues

275
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,208
these weren't just two cultures living side by side

276
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,166
they were becoming something new

277
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,291
for nearly three centuries

278
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,208
these Greek kingdoms flourished

279
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,041
from Bactria to the Punjab

280
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,250
they created something entirely new

281
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,500
Greek astronomy merged with Indian mathematics

282
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:01,000
Greek drama influenced Buddhist storytelling

283
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,708
and most importantly

284
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,416
Greek art was about to give Buddhism

285
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,333
its most recognizable symbol

286
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,708
from Buddha's death in 483 BCE

287
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,750
until the rise of the Indo Greek kingdoms around 180 BCE

288
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,208
nearly three centuries no one had dared

289
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,625
to show the Buddha's face

290
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,458
Buddhism spread across Asia

291
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,583
without anyone drawing Buddha's face

292
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,708
zero portraits not even a sketch

293
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,833
everyone knew his teachings

294
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,333
but if Buddha walked into a room

295
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,875
nobody would recognize him

296
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:38,041
instead they used symbols footprints

297
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,083
an empty throne a lotus flower

298
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
then the Greeks arrived with their challenge

299
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,041
accepted attitude and everything changed

300
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,583
in the workshops of Gandhara

301
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,083
Greek sculptors took an unprecedented step

302
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,875
using local schist stone and stucco

303
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,500
they brought Buddhist ideas to life

304
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,875
through Greek techniques

305
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,375
the stones dark color let them create subtle shadows

306
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,000
perfect for showing meditations

307
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,083
inner calm on an outer face

308
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,500
these artists used Greek proportional systems

309
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,708
the same mathematical ratios that built the Parthenon

310
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,750
to create the Buddha's face

311
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:17,583
they calculated the exact distances between eyes

312
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,708
the precise curve of the lips

313
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,208
the perfect arch of the eyebrows

314
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,000
each measurement followed Greek rules of divine beauty

315
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,500
look closely at these early Buddhas

316
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,333
the wavy hair that's Apollo style

317
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,083
the slight smile pure Greek

318
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,083
even the robes flow like those on Greek statues

319
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,041
but something new emerged in the details

320
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,791
the bump on Buddha's head

321
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,583
the ushnisha represents enlightened wisdom

322
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:48,083
the elongated earlobes recall his princely past

323
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,041
the dot between his eyebrows

324
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,875
the urna symbolizes spiritual sight

325
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,625
the fusion went deeper than surface details

326
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,375
Greek artists learn to show abstract Buddhist concepts

327
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,500
through visual symbols a Buddhist

328
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,333
half closed eyes

329
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,750
show the balance between awareness and detachment

330
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,583
the robes though Greek in style

331
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,083
reveal nothing of the body

332
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,583
beneath suggesting freedom from physical form

333
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,458
these Greek artists were basically the OG

334
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,708
Instagram filters they were like okay

335
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,208
we'll take Apollo's haircut

336
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,500
add some spiritual glow up features and boom

337
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,875
you've got the perfect combo of Greek style

338
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:25,875
and Buddhist chill

339
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,541
#nofilterneeded

340
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,500
this new artistic language spread like wildfire

341
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:33,958
merchants carried small

342
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,333
shift Buddha statues along the Silk Road

343
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,000
Chinese pilgrims took sketches home

344
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,333
each region adapted the style

345
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,666
Korea made the faces more angular

346
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,416
China softened the features

347
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,500
Japan refined the proportions

348
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,000
but

349
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,833
all kept that original Greek sense of human divinity

350
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,208
the style traveled south too

351
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,458
in the caves of Ajanta Indian

352
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,625
artists merged Greek naturalism with their own

353
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,958
flowing lines in Sri Lanka

354
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,041
the serene smile took on local features

355
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,750
while keeping its Greek essence

356
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,833
Southeast Asian Buddhas grew more elaborate

357
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,208
but maintain those core Greek proportions

358
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,000
but here's the real miracle

359
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,041
these weren't just beautiful objects

360
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,041
they solved a philosophical problem

361
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,416
how do you show the face of someone

362
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,291
who taught that the self doesn't exist?

363
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,625
Greek artists found a way

364
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,500
they created an image of perfect Serenity

365
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,375
a face that shows what lies beyond the self

366
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,958
we can still see their process today

367
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,916
in the ruins of Gandharan workshops

368
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,041
archaeologists found practice pieces

369
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,000
artists learning to carve the perfect curve of an ear

370
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,375
the exact angle of a meditation pose

371
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,541
they weren't just copying

372
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,958
they were creating a new visual language

373
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,833
that would spread across continents

374
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,458
this art became Buddhism's universal language

375
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:53,250
from tiny amulets to mountain sized statues

376
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:56,625
from Tibet to Thailand that Greek inspired face

377
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,000
carried Buddhism's message across cultures

378
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,166
and centuries

379
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,583
every Buddha statue today

380
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,541
whether in a temple or a garden shop

381
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,666
carries the fingerprints of those Greek artists

382
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,833
who dared to show the face of enlightenment

383
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,250
but the story doesn't end with art

384
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,208
hidden in monastery ruins and desert caves

385
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,000
ancient scrolls revealed an even deeper connection

386
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,833
in 1994 archaeologists in Afghanistan

387
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,208
uncovered fragments of bark manuscripts

388
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,041
Greek letters spelled out Buddhist teachings

389
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,583
the monks weren't just learning Greek art

390
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,875
they were writing their sacred texts in Greek

391
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,458
the Gandharan scrolls changed everything we knew

392
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,958
written in a mix of Greek and Gandhari script

393
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,916
these manuscripts showed Buddhist monks

394
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,583
wrestling with Greek concepts

395
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,750
they use the Greek word pneuma for consciousness

396
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,708
kosmos for the universe

397
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,916
one fragment shows them adapting Aristotle's logic

398
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,833
to explain Buddhist causation

399
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,041
in the ruins of Taxila

400
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,625
a copper scroll revealed something extraordinary

401
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,208
a Buddhist text about meditation

402
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,166
began with a quote from Pythagoras

403
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:07,375
the writer

404
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,708
seamlessly connected Greek ideas about harmony

405
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,583
with Buddhist teachings about inner peace

406
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,083
this wasn't cultural borrowing

407
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,708
it was true synthesis

408
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,833
the translations tell us even more

409
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,916
when Greeks encounter the Buddhist concept of sunyata

410
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:26,125
or emptiness they use their word kenon

411
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,041
the void

412
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,833
but they added notes explaining how the Buddhist

413
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,708
void was different from the Greek one

414
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,625
these weren't just translators

415
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,666
they were philosophical bridge builders

416
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,083
some scrolls show heated debates

417
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,125
a Greek philosopher argues that truth must be permanent

418
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,208
unchanging

419
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,333
a Buddhist monk responds by using Greek logical methods

420
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,083
to prove that change itself is the only constant

421
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,000
in the margins later

422
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,875
readers added comments in both scripts

423
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,041
continuing the debate across centuries

424
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,958
the Bamiyan Cave findings stunned researchers

425
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,750
get this these caves were

426
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,000
like

427
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,500
the ancient world's most ambitious crossover episode

428
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,291
imagine finding a place where Greek doctors

429
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,500
and Buddhist monks were comparing notes

430
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,000
it's like discovering that Hippocrates

431
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,416
and Buddha were sliding into each other's DMs

432
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,166
sharing medical advice and meditation tips

433
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,333
astronomical calculations

434
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,875
used Greek methods to time Buddhist festivals

435
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,166
even music theory merged

436
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,333
Greek harmonics applied to Buddhist chants

437
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,791
most fascinating are the philosophical dialogues

438
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,708
one scroll records a debate about the self

439
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,291
the Greeks argued for a permanent soul

440
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,041
using Plato's proofs

441
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:43,916
the Buddhist responded

442
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,458
with questions that sound surprisingly modern

443
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:50,875
if the self is permanent why does it change

444
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:54,958
if it's unified why does it conflict with itself

445
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,458
in a recent discovery

446
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,416
archaeologists found a scroll case

447
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:03,333
with an unexpected text a Greek philosophical work

448
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,125
filled with Buddhist concepts

449
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,958
had Greeks begun adopting Buddhist ideas

450
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:11,416
in their own writing the evidence suggests they did

451
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,750
some Greek philosophers started teaching meditation

452
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,416
others wrote about karma using Greek terms

453
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,458
these manuscripts show us something remarkable

454
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,958
a time when east and west weren't divided

455
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,125
when Greek and Buddhist ideas flowed freely

456
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,916
between minds seeking truth

457
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,500
the influence of these texts rippled through centuries

458
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:34,458
in Alexandria Greek philosophers began teaching methods

459
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,000
suspiciously similar to Buddhist meditation

460
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,333
the Desert Fathers Christianity's first monks

461
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,833
used practices that mirror Buddhist techniques

462
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,875
was this a coincidence

463
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,375
or had Greek Buddhist wisdom found new roots

464
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,416
neoplatanist philosophers wrote about emptying the mind

465
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,208
and transcending the self

466
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,666
ideas that would have sounded strange to Plato

467
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,500
but familiar to any Buddhist monk

468
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,541
Plotinus their greatest thinker

469
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,041
taught meditation methods

470
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,750
that could have come straight from a gundar

471
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,666
and monastery

472
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,958
the trail leads east to Chinese

473
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:12,333
Chan Buddhism which became Zen in Japan

474
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,458
shows marks of Greek influence

475
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,750
its emphasis on direct experience over scripture

476
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,750
its use of paradox and logic breaking questions

477
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,750
these mirror the Greek Buddhist debates

478
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,083
in our ancient scrolls

479
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,000
the famous Zen koans

480
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,250
might have roots in Greek philosophical puzzles

481
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,208
Islamic scholars discovered these texts

482
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,583
during their golden age

483
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,541
they translated Greek philosophy and Buddhist wisdom

484
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,666
side by side

485
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,291
the Sufi mystics in particular

486
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,125
seem to grasp something familiar

487
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,875
in these ancient dialogues

488
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,333
their whirling meditation has an interesting parallel

489
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,250
Greek philosophers had written about

490
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,916
circular contemplation

491
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,291
but perhaps

492
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,375
the most profound influence was on logic itself

493
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:58,166
Buddhist debaters armed with Greek logical methods

494
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,791
develop new ways of arguing about reality

495
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,250
these methods travel to Tibet

496
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,250
where they still form the backbone of monastic debates

497
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,041
when Tibetan monks clap and stamp during debates today

498
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,125
they're using techniques

499
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,375
refined in Greek Buddhist exchanges

500
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,125
the manuscripts even influenced art theory

501
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,750
Persian miniatures show Buddha

502
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,583
like sages in Greek poses

503
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,416
Chinese paintings of monks

504
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,708
sometimes give them Greek facial features

505
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,291
Japanese Zen art

506
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,291
uses empty space

507
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,916
in ways that echo Greek ideas about the void

508
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,250
in Europe when these texts were rediscovered

509
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,416
during the Renaissance

510
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,666
they sparked new interest in eastern thought

511
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:38,875
scholars realized

512
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,375
that ancient Greeks had found wisdom in the east

513
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,416
this helped pave the way for the spiritual dialogues

514
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:45,750
we're still having today

515
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,750
these aren't just historical curiosities

516
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,458
they show us something vital

517
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:53,125
that wisdom doesn't belong to east or west

518
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:55,333
truth when found

519
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,041
transcends borders

520
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,958
those ancient Greek Buddhist philosophers knew this

521
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:04,375
perhaps that's their most important lesson for us today

522
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:09,458
modern

523
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:12,333
archaeological digs keep uncovering new surprises

524
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,583
this is giving me serious Indiana Jones vibes

525
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,041
minus the booby traps

526
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:19,666
instead of finding the Ark of the Covenant

527
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,041
archaeologists

528
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,333
are uncovering evidence of history's greatest

529
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:26,041
cultural crossover and trust me

530
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:29,125
this is way cooler than any Marvel team up

531
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,500
in 2021

532
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,166
they found monastery ruins with Greek inscriptions

533
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,333
beneath Taliban controlled territory

534
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,041
remote sensing technology reveals entire lost cities

535
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,500
where Greeks and Buddhists once lived together

536
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:44,208
each discovery

537
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:46,666
fills in another piece of this forgotten chapter

538
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,708
but their legacy lives on in surprising ways

539
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,666
the Greek Buddhist investigation of consciousness

540
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,958
follows a clear line through history

541
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,333
Greek philosophers first documented meditations

542
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,625
effects in 326 BCE

543
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,791
medieval Islamic scholars studied these accounts

544
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,166
in their medical texts

545
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:10,083
European missionaries encountered these practices again

546
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:13,000
in the 1500s and today

547
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,500
neuroscientists at Harvard

548
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,791
studied Buddhist monks in MRI machines

549
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,250
asking the same questions

550
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,791
their Greek predecessors asked two millennia ago

551
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:25,291
when psychologists use mindfulness for treating anxiety

552
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,958
they're drawing from techniques first explored in Greek

553
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,291
Buddhist monasteries

554
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,000
look at modern Buddhist debates

555
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,750
in Tibetan monasteries

556
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,375
monks still use a method called Prasanga

557
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,666
taking an opponent's logic to its absurd conclusion

558
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:42,208
this technique

559
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:44,666
pure Greek dialectic

560
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:47,583
preserved for two millennia in Buddhist tradition

561
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,458
when monks clap their hands

562
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,250
and stamp their feet during debates

563
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,416
they're using gestures codified in Greek Buddhist texts

564
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:58,750
in Japanese Zen temples students face koans

565
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,916
like what is the sound of one hand clapping

566
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,000
these mind breaking riddles mirror the paradoxes

567
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,083
Greek Buddhists used to shatter conventional thinking

568
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:11,291
the famous Zen emphasis on direct experience

569
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:14,250
over book learning that came from Greek skeptics

570
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,791
who joined the Buddhist path

571
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:19,291
modern mindfulness apps talk about noting thoughts

572
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:20,458
without judgment

573
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:23,458
exactly what Greek Buddhist manuscripts described as

574
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,375
philosophical observation

575
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,083
popular meditation techniques like body scanning

576
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:28,958
combine Greek

577
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:31,583
systematic observation with Buddhist awareness

578
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:32,500
practices

579
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:36,041
even an architecture their influence continues

580
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:38,791
the precise measurements of Thai temples

581
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:41,625
the symmetrical layouts of Korean monasteries

582
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,750
the geometric mandalas of Tibetan Buddhism

583
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:48,000
all carry echoes of Greek mathematical principles

584
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,291
adapted for Buddhist sacred spaces

585
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,458
the Greek Buddhist tradition of questioning everything

586
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,500
survives in unexpected places

587
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:57,750
when Beat poets like Allen Ginsberg

588
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,458
combined Greek

589
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:01,041
Dionysian ecstasy with Buddhist meditation

590
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,125
they weren't inventing something new

591
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,250
they were rekindling an ancient flame

592
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,791
when modern philosophers like Peter Singer

593
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:11,916
use Buddhist logic to discuss ethics

594
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:15,250
they're continuing a dialogue started two millennia ago

595
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:19,625
some traditions are surprisingly direct descendants

596
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,708
the Christian Desert Fathers

597
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,000
who established western monasticism

598
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,833
used meditation techniques

599
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,916
suspiciously similar to Greek Buddhist practices

600
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:32,208
their emphasis on silence

601
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,083
their methods of contemplation

602
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,166
their way of questioning thoughts

603
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,125
all bear the hallmarks of Greek Buddhist influence

604
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,083
the last Greek Buddhist monastery

605
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,000
fell over 1,000 years ago

606
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,375
but their experiment continues

607
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:48,625
today's mindfulness revolution

608
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:51,541
the dialogue between science and meditation

609
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:54,916
the fusion of eastern wisdom with western psychology

610
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:56,958
these aren't new developments

611
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,500
they're the latest chapters in a story that began

612
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,375
when a Greek soldier

613
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:02,291
first sat down with a Buddhist monk

614
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,208
some say there are still undiscovered

615
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:10,583
Greek Buddhist monasteries

616
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,500
hidden in the mountains of Central Asia

617
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:15,500
satellite images show promising sites

618
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:18,833
local legends speak of ruins no Westerner has seen

619
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,333
but perhaps the real

620
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,833
undiscovered treasures aren't buried in the ground

621
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:26,000
they're buried in this ancient collaboration of minds

622
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:30,208
these Greeks and Buddhists proved something powerful

623
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,916
when different worlds meet with open minds

624
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
the impossible becomes possible

625
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,375
warriors can become monks

626
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:39,666
kings can become students

627
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,958
and two completely different ways of seeing the world

628
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:43,666
can create something entirely new

629
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:46,333
their story matters now more than ever

630
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,083
in a world often divided between east and west

631
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,916
their example shows another way

632
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,791
they remind us that the borders between cultures

633
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:55,500
are more flexible than we think

634
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58,791
that wisdom can speak in many languages

635
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,375
that truth knows no nationality

636
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:04,375
next time you see a Buddha statue

637
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,875
look closely at that serene Greek face

638
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:10,166
when you hear about scientists studying meditation

639
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:11,791
remember the Greek philosophers

640
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,250
who first took that journey

641
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,208
and when someone tells you

642
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:17,083
east and west are too different

643
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,625
to understand each other

644
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,791
remember the lost Greek Buddhists

645
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:24,083
they didn't just build bridges between cultures

646
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:26,833
they showed us those bridges were there all along

647
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,791
but this story has one last twist

648
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,416
recent satellite images

649
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:33,333
from a remote valley in Afghanistan

650
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,666
show something strange

651
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:37,625
something that looks like a massive monastery complex

652
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:39,541
untouched for centuries

653
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,541
could this be the legendary

654
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:42,625
great monastery

655
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:45,041
where Greeks and Buddhists first joined paths

656
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:48,833
that story will have to wait for another time

657
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:55,333

658
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,500
