in 2022 Google shut down its offices

00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,000
apple paused its operations

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,791
The World Bank stopped its meetings

4
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,875
world leaders sent condolences

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,250
why? a 95 year old Buddhist monk had passed away

6
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,833
but this wasn't just any monk

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
this was the man who turned ancient Buddhist wisdom

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
into a global revolution

9
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,125
the monk who taught Silicon Valley

10
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:35,083
how to think differently the spiritual master

11
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,625
who showed the world a new way to live

12
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,500
this was Thich Nhat Hanh

13
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,083
I'm Peter from Buddhist Wisdom

14
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:45,333
and

15
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,791
as someone who spent years studying Buddhist teachers

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Thich Nhat Hanh stands apart

17
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,583
what fascinates me most

18
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,208
isn't just his incredible journey

19
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:57,500
from a war torn country to global spiritual leader

20
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,000
it's how he took Buddha's 2500 year old teachings

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,875
and made them speak directly to our modern struggles

22
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,416
anxiety digital addiction

23
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,916
environmental crisis

24
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:11,208
the desperate search for meaning in a fast paced world

25
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,291
today we'll discover how this remarkable monk

26
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,166
changed Buddhism forever

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,750
revolutionized how science looks at the human mind

28
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,000
and left a legacy

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,291
that continues to transform lives around the world

30
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,333
this is the story of Thich Nhat Hanh

31
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:30,708
the rebel monk who changed how millions of people think

32
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:33,000
live and find peace

33
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:41,708
in 1926 amid the serene landscapes of central Vietnam

34
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,875
a child named Nguyen Xuan Bao was born

35
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,958
the boy who would become Thich Nhat Hanh

36
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,000
few could have predicted that this quiet child

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,041
from a small village

38
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:54,125
would one day shake the foundations of Buddhism itself

39
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,625
face exile from his homeland

40
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,833
and transform the minds of millions

41
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,583
including some of the world's most powerful leaders

42
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,333
and skeptical scientists

43
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,791
at 16 he entered Tu Hieu Temple

44
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:09,333
one of Vietnam's most ancient monasteries

45
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,125
while other teenage monks

46
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,291
focused solely on memorizing ancient sutras

47
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,958
young Thich Nhat Hanh spent hours

48
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,375
contemplating how Buddha's original teachings

49
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,166
could answer modern questions

50
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,000
during his early years of study

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,750
he discovered something profound

52
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,625
in Buddha's original methods

53
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,083
Buddha hadn't taught in temples

54
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,041
he taught in streets to merchants

55
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,916
kings and ordinary people

56
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,500
each teaching was practical

57
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:42,125
direct and meant to address real human suffering

58
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,291
this revelation shaped Thich Nhat Hanh

59
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,958
entire approach to Buddhism

60
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,500
while studying ancient texts

61
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,500
he began experimenting with teaching

62
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:51,875
methods

63
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,416
that would make Buddhism accessible to everyone

64
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,000
his superiors were skeptical

65
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,458
but he saw what many had missed

66
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,833
Buddhism needed to speak the language of its time

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,333
just as Buddha had done 2,500 years ago

68
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,833
by his mid 20s he had already started modernizing

69
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,083
how Buddhism was taught in his monastery

70
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,583
he believed the true Buddhist wisdom

71
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,958
wasn't found in complicated philosophy

72
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,416
but in practical daily actions

73
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,000
this understanding would later revolutionize

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,333
how the entire world approached mindfulness

75
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,500
and meditation

76
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,916
in 1942 another profound shift occurred

77
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,416
while many monasteries remained

78
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,583
isolated from the outside world

79
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:37,791
Thich Nhat Hanh

80
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,416
began integrating traditional Buddhist practices

81
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,916
with modern education he saw young monks

82
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,500
struggling to connect ancient teachings

83
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,500
with their daily lives his response

84
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,666
he started teaching Buddhism through poetry

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,958
contemporary stories and real world examples

86
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,625
methods that would later make him one of the most

87
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,833
influential spiritual teachers of our time

88
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,916
but his innovations were about to clash violently

89
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:10,000
with both tradition and the brutal realities of war

90
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,000
his next choices would either destroy

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,666
or define his legacy

92
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,708
while traditional Buddhist

93
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:23,125
monasteries remained focused on ancient rituals

94
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,500
and strict meditation practices

95
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,000
Thich Nhat Hanh saw a different path

96
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,083
he believed

97
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,291
Buddhist teachings weren't meant to be locked away

98
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,041
in temples

99
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:35,500
they were tools for transforming everyday suffering

100
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,875
into peace and understanding

101
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,666
this wasn't just a philosophical stance

102
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:44,166
he began teaching Buddhism in radically new ways

103
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,666
instead of complex sutras

104
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,208
he used simple phrases like breathe

105
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,541
you are alive

106
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:56,500
and peace in oneself peace in the world

107
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,375
his fellow monks were stunned

108
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,625
some called it oversimplified

109
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,875
others saw it as disrespectful to tradition

110
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,000
but Thich Nhat Hanh understood something essential

111
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,333
Buddha himself

112
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,958
had always adapted his teachings to his audience

113
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,500
in the late 1950s he made an even bolder move

114
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,333
at Saigon's An Quang Temple

115
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,875
he established the Institute of Higher Buddhist Studies

116
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,500
this wasn't just another Buddhist school

117
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,125
it was a revolutionary experiment

118
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,375
here monk studied psychology alongside meditation

119
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,500
social work alongside Buddhist philosophy

120
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,708
the message was clear

121
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,333
Buddhism needed to engage with the modern world

122
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,916
not retreat from it

123
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,916
but his most radical innovation was yet to come

124
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,666
as Vietnam descended into war

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,250
Thich Nhat Hanh developed what he called engaged Buddhism

126
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,208
this wasn't just about peaceful meditation

127
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,500
in monasteries

128
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,500
it was about bringing mindfulness into every action

129
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,916
every relationship every aspect of social change

130
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,500
Buddhism is already engaged

131
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,833
he would say if it's authentic Buddhism

132
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,625
he pointed to how Buddha himself had prevented wars

133
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,625
counseled kings and helped resolve social conflicts

134
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,125
this wasn't a new interpretation

135
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,375
it was a return to Buddhism's original purpose

136
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,625
transforming suffering in all its forms

137
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,666
yet as his influence grew

138
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:33,541
so did the resistance traditional Buddhist authorities

139
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,875
saw him as a threat to their authority

140
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,000
government officials watched his growing movement

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,208
with suspicion

142
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,000
the young monk was walking a dangerous line

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,583
between spiritual revolution and political Defiance

144
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,708
when bombs began falling across Vietnam

145
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,125
Thich Nhat Hanh faced a crucial decision

146
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,625
many religious leaders

147
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,000
urged to retreat to the safety of temples

148
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:18,166
instead he let his students into the heart of suffering

149
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,958
picture them young monks in brown robes

150
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,750
moving through smoke filled streets

151
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,083
the sound of distant explosions

152
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,916
mixing with their mindful steps

153
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,833
they rebuilt bombed villages

154
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,333
their bare hands clearing rubble

155
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,541
while fighter jets roared overhead

156
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,125
they evacuated children from war zones

157
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,000
teaching them breathing exercises

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,875
to stay calm during the chaos

159
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,708
this wasn't just humanitarian work

160
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,666
it was Buddhism in action

161
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,750
in 1965

162
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,375
he founded the school of youth for Social Service

163
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:58,958
imagine young monks and nuns clad and brown robes

164
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,250
peddling bicycles through war torn villages

165
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,458
their baskets brimming with medicine

166
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,541
food and hope

167
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,000
they didn't take sides they helped anyone in need

168
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:13,708
this neutrality

169
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,458
made them targets for both sides of the conflict

170
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,208
several of his students were killed

171
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,500
others were wounded but they kept going

172
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,416
practicing what Thich Nhat Hanh called

173
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,375
being peace in the midst of war

174
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,583
even in the darkest moments of war

175
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,541
he maintained his conviction about mindful living

176
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,083
keeping your body healthy is an expression of gratitude

177
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,708
to the whole cosmos the trees

178
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,500
the clouds everything

179
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,000
he would remind his students

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,541
as they serve their community

181
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,750
this wasn't just philosophy

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,541
it was survival wisdom for young monks and nuns

183
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,458
working in dangerous conditions

184
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,666
everyday brought impossible choices

185
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,166
each time

186
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,875
he sent his students to help in dangerous areas

187
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,958
he knew they might not return

188
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,541
several didn't

189
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,416
the weight of these decisions tested

190
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,041
not just his leadership

191
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,666
but the very principles of peaceful engagement

192
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,458
he taught

193
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:14,000
his actions caught international attention

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,333
in 1966

195
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,458
he traveled to the United States to advocate for peace

196
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,208
his message was powerful but controversial

197
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,208
in a conflict there is no winner

198
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,875
both sides lose he spoke at universities

199
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:32,333
met with military leaders and testified before Congress

200
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,250
his words resonated with a young Martin Luther King Jr

201
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,708
who publicly opposed the Vietnam War

202
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,250
shortly after meeting him

203
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,458
their meeting sparked a profound friendship

204
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:48,958
King moved by Thich Nhat Hanh commitment to non violence

205
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:53,375
nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1967

206
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,500
writing

207
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,458
later Thich Nhat Hanh would develop engaged Buddhism

208
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,708
partly inspired by kings methods of peaceful activism

209
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,500
but this piece work came at a heavy price

210
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,916
while in America

211
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:26,666
Thich Nhat Hanh received news that shook him to his core

212
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,250
he was banned from returning to Vietnam

213
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,500
his own country had exiled him

214
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,958
the government saw his peace activism as a threat

215
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,666
traditional Buddhist leaders

216
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,833
criticized his political engagement

217
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,000
at just 40 years old

218
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,500
he found himself a monk without a home

219
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,125
exile could have silenced Thich Nhat Hanh

220
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,291
instead it amplified his voice

221
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,000
from his new base in France

222
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,458
he began building something extraordinary

223
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:01,833
Plum Village the first Buddhist monastery in the west

224
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,791
that welcomed everyday people to learn mindfulness

225
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,750
but this wasn't your typical monastery

226
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,916
imagine wooden meditation halls

227
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,208
nestled among Rolling Hills

228
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,500
pathways winding through blooming cherry trees

229
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,875
and the sound of mindfulness bells

230
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:24,041
carried by the breeze simple yet elegant

231
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,708
buildings housed hundreds of practitioners

232
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,333
while gardens overflowed with vegetables

233
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,041
tended by mindful hands here

234
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,000
beneath towering oak trees

235
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,625
even the morning light filtering through leaves

236
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,500
became a lesson in presence

237
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,583
walking paths had signs like breathe and smile

238
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,166
instead of keep silent

239
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,500
children played freely

240
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,750
families practiced meditation together

241
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,208
business executives sat alongside artists and activists

242
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,708
Thich Nhat Hanh had created something revolutionary

243
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,875
a place where ancient Buddhist wisdom met modern life

244
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,875
his daily interactions with students

245
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,833
revealed his general teaching style

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,791
during walking meditation

247
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,208
he would often remind everyone

248
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,958
this simple instruction transformed a basic

249
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,083
activity

250
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,833
into a profound practice of mindfulness and gratitude

251
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,291
his approach to teaching was equally revolutionary

252
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,958
he'd often begin by holding up an orange

253
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
this orange he'd say

254
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,625
contains the sun the rain

255
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,125
the earth

256
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,000
the farmer's hands

257
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,500
when you peel it mindfully

258
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,333
you touch the entire universe

259
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,708
complex Buddhist concepts of interconnection

260
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,500
explained through a simple orange

261
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,625
this was his genius

262
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,541
making profound wisdom accessible to everyone

263
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,666
the world took notice

264
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,875
major companies like Google

265
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,958
invited him to teach mindfulness to their employees

266
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:08,500
his book sold over 15 million copies in 47 languages

267
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,208
including bestsellers like Being Peace

268
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,500
and the miracle of mindfulness

269
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,250
as he often said peace in oneself

270
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,666
peace in the world

271
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,166
a simple phrase that resonated from meditation halls

272
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,708
to corporate boardrooms

273
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,500
even the World Economic Forum welcomed his teachings

274
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,708
the monk who had once been called a heretic

275
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,875
was now being hailed as

276
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,750
the father of modern mindfulness

277
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,416
but success brought scrutiny

278
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,375
critics accused him of watering down Buddhism

279
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,833
some called his teachings Buddhism lite

280
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,458
he faced a crucial question

281
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,916
could ancient wisdom survive this modern transformation

282
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,500
without losing its essence

283
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,291
when confronted about simplifying Buddhism

284
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,583
he responded with one of his most famous teachings

285
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,125
this perfectly captured his approach

286
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,333
profound wisdom expressed through simple

287
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,750
accessible language

288
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:16,416
but perhaps his most significant impact was on science

289
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,625
western researchers

290
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:23,041
intrigued by his methods began studying mindfulness

291
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:23,833
their

292
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:27,041
findings validated what he had been teaching all along

293
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,458
mindful breathing

294
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:31,875
walking and eating could literally change the brain

295
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,541
reduce stress and improve well being

296
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,000
MRI scans showed that

297
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,958
just eight weeks of mindfulness practice

298
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,333
could increase gray matter

299
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,916
in areas of the brain associated with learning

300
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,500
memory and emotional regulation

301
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,125
his simple techniques were revolutionizing

302
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,208
our understanding of the human mind

303
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,750
Today Thich Nhat Hanh's fingerprints are everywhere

304
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,083
when Silicon Valley

305
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,541
engineers take mindful breaks between coding

306
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,541
they're practicing his teachings

307
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,500
when schools start their day with a mindful minute

308
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:11,625
that's his influence when doctors prescribe mindfulness

309
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,833
for stress and anxiety they're building on his work

310
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,875
but his greatest legacy

311
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,666
might be how he transformed Buddhism itself

312
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,208
before him

313
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,291
meditation was often seen as an escape from life

314
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:30,375
he showed it could be a way of living life more fully

315
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:35,375
the miracle he taught is not walking on water

316
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,375
the miracle is walking on the green earth

317
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,208
dwelling deeply in the present moment

318
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,500
feeling truly alive

319
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,875
in 2014 at age 88

320
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,583
he suffered a severe stroke

321
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,375
unable to speak

322
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,791
he demonstrated his teachings one final time

323
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,250
his students reported that even in the hospital

324
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,500
he remained mindful fully present

325
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,875
peaceful accepting

326
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,041
he returned to Vietnam in 2018

327
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,125
coming full circle

328
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,833
to spend his final days at Tu Hieu Temple

329
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,375
where his journey began

330
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,000
his last written words to his students

331
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,750
embodied everything he had taught

332
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,625
this wasn't just poetry

333
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,750
it was his final teaching on interconnection

334
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,041
and impermanence

335
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,500
when he passed away in 2022

336
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,291
something remarkable happened

337
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,791
his death wasn't just mourned

338
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,083
it was celebrated as a testament to his teachings

339
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,666
people around the world

340
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,000
practiced mindful breathing in his honor

341
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,791
continuing the simple

342
00:16:56,791 --> 00:17:01,208
yet profound practice he had taught them

343
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,750
think about it a boy from rural Vietnam

344
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,416
transformed

345
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:08,041
how millions of people relate to their own minds

346
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:12,416
he showed that Buddha's 2,500 year old teachings

347
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,625
weren't relics of the past

348
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,208
but vital tools for our future

349
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,916
in a world of increasing chaos and distraction

350
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,291
his message is more relevant than ever

351
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,583
peace is possible

352
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,333
and it begins with a single mindful breath

353
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,708
what makes Thich Nhat Hanh's story so remarkable

354
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,541
isn't just what he achieved

355
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,375
it's what he revealed about human potential

356
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,250
he showed that ancient Buddhist wisdom

357
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,625
isn't just for monks and monasteries

358
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,375
it's for mothers calming their children

359
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,625
executives making difficult decisions

360
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,875
activists working for change

361
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,041
and anyone seeking peace in their daily lives

362
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,958
look around today mindfulness apps on our phones

363
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,291
meditation rooms and office buildings

364
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,083
school children learning to breathe mindfully

365
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,500
these aren't just trends they're the seeds

366
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,291
Thich Nhat Hanh planted now blossoming worldwide

367
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,125
in one of his final teachings

368
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,791
he said something profound

369
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,083
think about that

370
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,875
every step he took was mindful

371
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,000
every word he spoke came from compassion

372
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,000
every action showed how spiritual practice

373
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,041
and daily life could be one

374
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,666
he proved that one person

375
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,583
moving mindfully and with clear purpose

376
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,166
can transform the world

377
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,708
not through force or loud proclamations

378
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,541
but through gentle persistent wisdom

379
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,833
through being fully present

380
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,833
through choosing peace

381
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
as we face new global challenges

382
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,916
climate change digital addiction

383
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:00,958
mental health crises his teachings offer a path forward

384
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,208
the question isn't whether these ancient practices work

385
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,583
in our modern world Thich Nhat Hanh prove they do

386
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,958
the real question is

387
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,291
how will you bring mindfulness into your life

388
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,833
what seeds of peace will you plant today

389
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,333
I'm Peter from Buddha's wisdom

390
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,875
if this story moved you

391
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,041
take a moment now to breathe mindfully

392
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,708
just as Thich Nhat Hanh taught

393
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,583
and remember peace is every step

394
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,000
