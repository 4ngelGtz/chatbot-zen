00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:09,766
six months ago Matt read chapters 6 through 10

2
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:11,466
from the Dhammapada for us

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,300
since then many of you have asked

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,500
for a deeper exploration of their meaning

5
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,133
that's exactly what we'll do today

6
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:20,766
I'm Peter from Buddha's wisdom

7
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:23,633
and we're diving into some of the most psychologically

8
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:26,200
sophisticated wisdom ever recorded

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,566
what fascinated me about revisiting Matt's reading

10
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:32,266
was how these 2,500 year old verses

11
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:33,766
sound like they were written

12
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:37,833
specifically for 2025 we're living through times

13
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:41,000
when it's harder than ever to distinguish real wisdom

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,333
from clever marketing

15
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:45,400
genuine freedom from the illusion of choice

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,333
and meaningful progress from busy work

17
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,500
the Buddha understood something about human nature

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,466
that behavioral science is just catching up to

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,200
these chapters don't just describe enlightened states

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,566
they're practical guides

21
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:03,633
for anyone trying to build something meaningful

22
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:04,800
while staying sane

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,900
remember in our first deep dive

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,566
we explored how mind proceeds all things

25
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:12,366
well these five chapters

26
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:13,466
show us what happens

27
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:15,766
when you actually master that principle

28
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:18,166
from recognizing true wisdom

29
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:21,266
to understanding why small choices compound into

30
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:23,066
life changing consequences

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,433
so let's explore Chapter 6

32
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:26,300
which starts with

33
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,100
what might be the best leadership advice

34
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,266
you'll ever hear

35
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,666
should one find a wise critic to point out faults

36
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:40,300
and give valuable advice let one follow such a sage

37
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,700
as one would a guide to hidden treasure

38
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:45,266
this opening verse hits different

39
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:47,433
when you realize most people spend their lives

40
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:49,800
avoiding exactly this kind of person

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,300
we live in an age of echo chambers

42
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,000
and confirmation bias

43
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,933
where algorithms feed us content we already agree with

44
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:58,800
but

45
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,966
the Buddha understood something crucial about growth

46
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,500
you need someone who cares enough about your success

47
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,600
to risk making you uncomfortable

48
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,900
notice he doesn't say

49
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,800
find someone who's always positive

50
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,400
or surround yourself with cheerleaders

51
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:17,466
he says find someone who will point out your faults

52
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,700
Warren Buffett calls this his inner circle

53
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,700
people who will tell him

54
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,100
when he's about to make a terrible decision

55
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:27,766
Jeff Bezos built this principle into Amazon's culture

56
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:31,166
with what they call disagree and commit

57
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,600
the most successful people actively seek out

58
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,200
what researchers call constructive criticism

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,200
but here's what most people miss

60
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,000
the verse says

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,900
such a sage as one would a guide to hidden treasure

62
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,600
your blind spots aren't just obstacles to avoid

63
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,666
they're actually where your greatest potential lies

64
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,233
hidden irrigators guide the water

65
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:56,633
fletchers shape the arrow

66
00:02:56,633 --> 00:03:00,466
carpenters bend the wood the wise control themselves

67
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,766
I love this verse

68
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,533
because it destroys the myth of natural talent

69
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,133
everything valuable requires skilled shaping

70
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:11,100
you don't just stumble into wisdom

71
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,100
any more than you stumble into a perfectly

72
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,166
crafted arrow

73
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:18,333
the irrigation metaphor is particularly relevant today

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,266
we're drowning in information but starving for wisdom

75
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,366
wise people don't consume everything

76
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:30,300
they direct their mental energy like farmers

77
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,666
directing water to where it's needed most

78
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,200
but the real game changer comes next

79
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:38,166
like a deep lake clear and unruffled

80
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,900
the wise become tranquil after hearing the Dhamma

81
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,233
most people

82
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:45,266
become more agitated the more information they consume

83
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,733
check your own experience

84
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,233
how do you feel

85
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:51,900
after scrolling social media for an hour

86
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,866
probably not like a deep lake clear and unruffled

87
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:01,633
wise people develop what I call mental filtration

88
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:03,200
they can receive information

89
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,000
without being disturbed by it

90
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,300
they've learned to separate signal from noise

91
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,666
the practical application

92
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,466
try this experiment

93
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:16,533
for one week before consuming any content news

94
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,766
social media even educational material

95
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,200
ask yourself

96
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:25,533
will this make me more like a clear lake

97
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,766
or more like churning water

98
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:29,766
you'll be surprised

99
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:32,000
how much of what we think is staying informed

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,133
is actually just mental pollution

101
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:37,500
the chapter ends with this reality check

102
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,366
few among men are those who cross to the further shore

103
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,200
the rest the bulk of men

104
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,500
only run up and down the hither bank

105
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,700
most people stay busy

106
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,133
chasing the same problems again and again

107
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,466
mistaking motion for progress

108
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:54,300
they run up and down the same patterns

109
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,300
the same limited thinking

110
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:59,533
true wisdom isn't about moving faster

111
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,366
it's about actually crossing over to new understanding

112
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:04,366
which brings us to Chapter 7

113
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:06,600
where the Buddha shows us what total freedom

114
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,133
actually looks like

115
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:14,666
at first glance

116
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:17,166
Arahat sounds like a lofty Buddhist title

117
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,400
but if you've ever had

118
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,700
even a fleeting moment of complete peace

119
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:22,900
no craving no worry

120
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:24,466
no inner conflict

121
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,333
you've glimpsed what this means

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,433
the Arahat (Pali for "one who is worthy")

123
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:32,733
has extinguished what Buddhism calls

124
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,800
the three roots of suffering

125
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:37,300
greed lobha

126
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:39,933
hatred dosa

127
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:42,366
and delusion Moha

128
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:44,866
there is no more suffering

129
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:47,066
for one who has completed the journey

130
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:48,933
who is free from sorrow

131
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,600
who has freed oneself on all sides

132
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,166
who has thrown off all shackles

133
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:57,566
before you think this is just religious idealism

134
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,100
consider what these shackles actually are

135
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:02,000
you know that constant background

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,100
anxiety about what others think of you gone

137
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,566
that endless cycle of wanting the next thing

138
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:11,066
the next achievement the next experience broken

139
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:14,466
the exhausting need to defend your image and be right

140
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:16,333
all the time released

141
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,900
but here's what's fascinating

142
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,566
 the Buddha

143
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:22,600
doesn't describe this person as passive or withdrawn

144
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,266
the mindful exert themselves

145
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:27,000
they are not attached to any home

146
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,966
like swans that abandon the lake

147
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,400
they leave home after home behind

148
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,466
this is describing someone who's fully engaged

149
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:37,900
but not trapped like swans that can land on any lake

150
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,700
but aren't confined to one

151
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,833
they can engage completely with life

152
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,500
without being imprisoned by circumstances

153
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,300
I remember working with a business leader

154
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,100
who embodied this principle

155
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:53,400
she was deeply committed to her company's success

156
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,700
but not emotionally trapped by it

157
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,800
when market conditions required a complete pivot

158
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:02,200
she could adapt without the psychological resistance

159
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,100
that paralyzes most people

160
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,800
engaged but not attached

161
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:09,233
even the gods hold dear the wise

162
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:10,700
one whose senses are subdued

163
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,200
like horses well trained by a charioteer

164
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,766
your senses what you see here

165
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:17,566
feels are like powerful horses

166
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:20,600
untrained they pull you in every direction

167
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,866
trained they become your allies

168
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,600
this becomes crucial in our age of design

169
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,866
to be addictive content every app

170
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:28,800
every platform

171
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,300
is engineered to capture and hold your attention

172
00:07:32,066 --> 00:07:33,800
the Arahat represents someone

173
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,433
who has trained their senses to serve wisdom

174
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:38,200
rather than impulse

175
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:42,400
the chapter ends beautifully

176
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,200
delightful are the forests

177
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,033
where worldlings find no pleasure

178
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,100
there the passionless will rejoice

179
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:50,733
for they seek no sensual pleasures

180
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:53,300
this isn't about becoming a monk

181
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,233
it's about finding satisfaction

182
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,100
that doesn't depend on constant

183
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,800
external stimulation

184
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,500
the Arahat has discovered what researchers call

185
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:07,033
intrinsic joy happiness that comes from within

186
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:08,600
rather than from getting things

187
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:10,700
understanding this level of freedom

188
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,933
naturally makes us ask what really matters

189
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:17,000
Chapter 8 uses a brilliant teaching method

190
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,400
to answer that question

191
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:25,100
the Buddha was brilliant at using numbers

192
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,666
to make a point throughout Chapter 8

193
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,600
he keeps using "a thousand" as his measuring stick

194
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:33,566
but he's not really talking about math

195
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:36,466
he's talking about what actually moves

196
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:37,933
the needle in your life

197
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,900
better than 1,000 useless words is one useful word

198
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,866
hearing which one attains peace

199
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:47,766
we're living in the age of content overload podcasts

200
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:50,000
YouTube videos articles posts

201
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:51,566
stories reels

202
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,800
but how much of it actually changes anything

203
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,700
most of us consume thousands of hours of content

204
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,800
that make zero lasting impact

205
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:04,300
think about it can you recall even one sentence

206
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,666
that truly changed how you see the world

207
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,800
meanwhile the rest fades like background noise

208
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,733
that's exactly what the Buddha points to

209
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:15,200
then he drops

210
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,266
what might be the most

211
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:18,500
important verse in the entire Dhammapada

212
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:22,266
though one may conquer 1,000 times

213
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:23,666
a thousand men in battle

214
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,833
yet he indeed is the noblest victor

215
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,966
who conquers himself

216
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,100
external victories feel sweet in the moment

217
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,133
but how quickly they evaporate

218
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,400
reputation lost overnight

219
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:39,066
wealth wiped out in a market crash

220
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:41,766
status destroyed by one scandal

221
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,400
but internal mastery

222
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:47,300
no one can take that from you

223
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,300
but the Buddha gets even more specific

224
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
month after month for 1,000 years

225
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,166
one may make offerings with 1,000 coins

226
00:09:55,566 --> 00:09:57,366
yet if only for a moment

227
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,766
one pays homage to a person perfected in meditation

228
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:04,000
that homage is better than a century of sacrifice

229
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:09,433
translation five minutes of genuine learning

230
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:11,666
from someone who has mastered themselves

231
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,800
beats years of empty rituals

232
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,733
or surface level networking

233
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:18,433
this principle applies everywhere

234
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:20,633
one honest conversation with a mentor

235
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:21,633
who challenges you

236
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:24,700
beats hundreds of hours of random networking events

237
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,633
one book that genuinely shifts your perspective

238
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:28,500
beats dozens

239
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,266
that just confirm what you already believe

240
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,633
one moment of true self awareness

241
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,900
beats years of self help

242
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,900
consumption without application

243
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,300
the chapter builds to this crescendo

244
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,033
better than living 100 years

245
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:44,633
not seeing the supreme truth

246
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:47,766
is living one day seeing the supreme truth

247
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:51,366
the supreme truth isn't some mystical concept

248
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:52,900
it's seeing reality clearly

249
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,166
instead of through the filters of your conditioning

250
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,500
fears and wishful thinking

251
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,566
most people go their entire lives

252
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:02,233
without one day of clear seeing

253
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:04,233
they see through the lens of their past

254
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:06,900
their ego their fears about the future

255
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,400
but one day of genuine clarity

256
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,100
understanding how your mind actually works

257
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:14,200
how your emotions actually function

258
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,100
is worth more than decades of living on autopilot

259
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:19,966
here is a practical test

260
00:11:19,966 --> 00:11:21,833
at the end of each day this week

261
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:22,633
ask yourself

262
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,300
did I encounter any truth today

263
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,700
that actually changed how I see things

264
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,100
if the answer is consistently no

265
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,200
you might be consuming thousands of words

266
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,566
without finding the one that leads to peace

267
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,400
which brings us to Chapter 9

268
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,200
where the Buddha examines how we drift away from truth

269
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,800
through small compromises

270
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:51,766
Chapter 9 doesn't moralize about evil

271
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,633
the Buddha analyzes it like a scientist

272
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:56,566
studying a natural phenomenon

273
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,700
as Matt guided us through these verses

274
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,966
make haste in doing good restrain your mind from evil

275
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:06,433
he who is slow in doing good

276
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:08,133
his mind delights in evil

277
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:10,966
notice the psychology here

278
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:12,066
modern neuroscience

279
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:15,133
now describes what the Buddha already knew intuitively

280
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:17,266
the formation of neuroplastic

281
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:19,600
habit loops that drive our behaviors

282
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,800
there's no neutral zone

283
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:24,033
your mind is always moving toward

284
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:26,500
either wholesome or unwholesome patterns

285
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:30,100
when you're not actively cultivating good

286
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,366
you're passively drifting toward its opposite

287
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,566
this isn't about religious morality

288
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:40,700
it's about understanding how habits and neural pathways

289
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,066
actually work

290
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,066
every choice you make is training your brain

291
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:47,566
to make similar choices in the future

292
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,200
every time you choose the easier path

293
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,366
over the right path

294
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:54,466
you're making the right path harder to choose next time

295
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:55,700
but then

296
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,466
the Buddha gives us one of the most important insights

297
00:12:58,466 --> 00:12:59,900
about consequences

298
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:02,300
think not lightly of evil

299
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,300
saying it will not come to me

300
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,800
drop by drop is the water pot filled

301
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:11,933
likewise the fool gathering it little by little

302
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,400
fills himself with evil

303
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:17,566
no one sets out to become a liar

304
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:20,466
but one small distortion one avoided truth

305
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,600
one rationalized shortcut

306
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:26,566
and years later you barely recognize who you've become

307
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:29,100
this drop by drop principle

308
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,800
explains how people end up in destructive patterns

309
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,666
without ever making a conscious decision to go there

310
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:37,600
decision scientists call this moral drift

311
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,900
the gradual erosion of ethical standards

312
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,366
through small concessions

313
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,166
but the Buddha understood it perfectly

314
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,100
destructive patterns accumulate gradually

315
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,500
through choices that seem harmless at the time

316
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:53,400
the good news the same principle works in reverse

317
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,066
think not lightly of good

318
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:57,100
saying it will not come to me

319
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,733
drop by drop is the water pot filled

320
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:04,000
likewise the wise man gathering it little by little

321
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:05,933
fills himself with good

322
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,833
this is why small daily practices matter so much

323
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,500
reading one page of wisdom

324
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,466
taking one mindful breath

325
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,933
making one kind gesture these seem insignificant

326
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,466
but they're filling your internal water pot

327
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:21,666
drop by drop

328
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:24,700
I Learned this lesson personally

329
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,400
when I delayed

330
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,966
giving honest feedback to someone I cared about

331
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:29,666
thinking I was being kind

332
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,133
months later

333
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,533
I realized I had let them walk blind into failure

334
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,733
not because I didn't care

335
00:14:36,966 --> 00:14:38,166
but because I lacked

336
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,966
the courage to make them uncomfortable

337
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,000
when it mattered

338
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,633
the chapter ends with a sobering truth

339
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,566
neither in the sky nor in mid ocean

340
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:48,500
nor by entering into mountain clefts

341
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,933
nowhere in the world

342
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,233
is there a place where one may escape

343
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:54,266
from the results of evil deeds

344
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:57,033
this isn't about divine punishment

345
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:59,733
it's about the natural law of consequences

346
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,333
your actions shape your character

347
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,800
your character shapes your choices

348
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,566
and your choices shape your life

349
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:09,966
there's no geographic location

350
00:15:09,966 --> 00:15:12,033
where you can escape from who you've become

351
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:13,133
through your actions

352
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:16,766
understanding how destructive patterns develop

353
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,633
naturally leads us to understand

354
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:20,666
how we can avoid creating suffering

355
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,400
for ourselves and others

356
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:27,400
Chapter 10 completes this teaching

357
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,700
the final chapter Matt guided us through

358
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,300
contains what might be the most practical wisdom

359
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,366
for living in a complex world

360
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,400
the Buddha begins with a simple

361
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,700
but profound observation

362
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,633
all tremble at punishment

363
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:49,200
all fear death drawing the parallel to yourself

364
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:52,466
neither kill nor get others to kill

365
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:55,866
this isn't just about physical violence

366
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:58,000
the Buddha is pointing out something fundamental

367
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,666
about human psychology

368
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:02,800
everyone wants to be safe and happy

369
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,300
everyone fears pain and death

370
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,066
this universal truth becomes the foundation

371
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,666
for ethical behavior

372
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:13,500
the most effective negotiators and leaders

373
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,266
understand that everyone

374
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:16,900
even their opponents

375
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,733
shares these basic human needs

376
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,866
when you truly internalize this

377
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,466
it becomes much harder to dehumanize others

378
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:29,700
think about your own relationships

379
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,933
that person who frustrated you today

380
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,033
they want happiness and safety just like you

381
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:37,600
do that difficult colleague

382
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:39,933
same basic human needs

383
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,800
this recognition doesn't excuse bad behavior

384
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,400
but it changes how you respond to it

385
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:49,700
but the chapter goes deeper

386
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,766
whoever seeking his own happiness hurts with the rod

387
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:54,800
others who also desire happiness

388
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,166
will not find happiness after death

389
00:16:57,566 --> 00:17:00,233
the Buddha isn't talking about afterlife punishment

390
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:02,766
here he's describing a natural law

391
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:04,866
when you pursue your happiness

392
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:07,800
at the expense of others who also want happiness

393
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:09,833
you create conditions that

394
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,100
ultimately undermine your own well being

395
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,666
in business leaders

396
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,766
who advance themselves

397
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:16,666
by destroying their team's morale

398
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,300
might succeed short term

399
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,100
but they create environments that eventually

400
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,866
become toxic even for themselves

401
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:25,700
in families

402
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,800
parents who control through fear might get compliance

403
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:30,366
but they eroded the trust

404
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:32,400
that makes genuine connection possible

405
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,566
the chapter gives us a beautiful alternative

406
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,566
if like a broken gong

407
00:17:37,566 --> 00:17:40,400
you silence yourself you have approached Nibbana

408
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,966
for vindictiveness is no longer in you

409
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,466
imagine a gong struck hard

410
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:47,500
yet silent that's the power of a mind

411
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,200
that has broken free from automatic reactivity

412
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,500
a gong that's been broken doesn't ring when struck

413
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,500
similarly a person who has transcended vindictiveness

414
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,900
doesn't automatically strike back

415
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,966
when hit by criticism insults or attacks

416
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,166
they've broken the cycle of automatic reaction

417
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:09,066
this doesn't mean becoming passive

418
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:12,066
it means developing the freedom to choose your response

419
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:14,866
rather than being controlled by your impulses

420
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,133
the chapter builds to this powerful recognition

421
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,400
only rarely is there a man in this world who

422
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,600
restrained by modesty avoids reproach

423
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,333
as a thoroughbred horse avoids the whip

424
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,600
the thoroughbred horse is so sensitive and well trained

425
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,966
that it responds to the slightest touch

426
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,300
it doesn't need harsh correction

427
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,766
because it's developed

428
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:39,933
inner sensitivity to what's right

429
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:44,466
similarly a person who has developed inner wisdom

430
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:47,166
doesn't need external rules and punishments to behave

431
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:47,966
ethically

432
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,600
they've developed internal guidance

433
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,200
this is the ultimate goal of wisdom development

434
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,733
not blind obedience to external rules

435
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,366
but the cultivation of inner awareness

436
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:02,400
that naturally guides you toward beneficial actions

437
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,800
six months ago when Matt first recited these verses

438
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:11,866
I wasn't sure

439
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:14,566
everyone would appreciate how practical they are

440
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:17,366
but looking at your comments and messages

441
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:20,366
it's clear these teachings hit something deep

442
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,866
what strikes me most about Chapter 6 through 10

443
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:26,700
is how they build a complete system

444
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,100
for human development

445
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,466
Chapter 6

446
00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:32,233
shows us how to recognize and cultivate wisdom

447
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:34,066
through choosing the right people

448
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,500
and training our minds skillfully

449
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:40,366
Chapter 7 reveals what complete freedom looks like

450
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:42,200
not withdrawal from life

451
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,533
but engagement without attachment

452
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:48,666
Chapter 8 teaches us to focus on what actually matters

453
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,500
instead of getting lost in impressive

454
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:53,666
but meaningless activity Chapter 9

455
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,600
helps us understand how destructive patterns develop

456
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,533
gradually

457
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,266
and how to break them before they break us

458
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:05,500
Chapter 10 grounds everything in our shared humanity

459
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,800
we all want happiness and safety

460
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,400
and that recognition

461
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,933
becomes the foundation for wise action

462
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:16,033
remember from our first deep dive

463
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:18,333
how mind precedes all things

464
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,366
today we've seen what happens when you master your mind

465
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:27,000
you stop being a prisoner of your own patterns

466
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:29,500
you cross to the further shore

467
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:33,566
this week try to apply Chapter Six's wisdom

468
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,500
identify one person in your life

469
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,100
who cares enough about your growth

470
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,900
to give you honest feedback

471
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:40,866
then actually ask for it

472
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,900
not about what you're doing wrong

473
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,366
but about what you're not seeing clearly

474
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,166
the Dhammapada isn't meant to be read once

475
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,400
and understood these are principles to return to

476
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:56,300
to test in your actual life to let mature over time

477
00:20:58,266 --> 00:21:00,466
Matt will be back soon with more pure readings

478
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:02,000
and I'll continue unpacking

479
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,633
how this ancient wisdom applies

480
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:05,133
to our modern challenges

481
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,666
because the more things change

482
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,600
the more these fundamental truths about human nature

483
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,166
remain constant

484
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,000
drop a comment below

485
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,500
which of these chapters feels most alive for you

486
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,133
right now which one is your current battlefield

487
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,700
your reflections

488
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,233
might just give someone else the insight they needed

489
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:26,133
today

490
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,566
this is Peter from Buddha's wisdom

491
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,266
thanks for taking this journey

492
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:32,866
through some of the most psychologically

493
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:35,200
sophisticated teachings ever recorded

494
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:38,133
stay curious stay wise
