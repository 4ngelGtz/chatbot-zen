2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,640
the teachings of epicus a former Roman

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,640
slave turned stoic philosopher and the

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,519
Buddha the founder of one of the world's

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,800
great religions may seem Worlds Apart at

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,320
first

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,279
glance but when we explore their

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:34,600
teachings we find surprising similarity

9
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,239
these two thinkers separated by time and

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,920
culture reached remarkably similar

11
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:42,640
conclusions about the human condition

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,320
and the path to Inner

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,760
Peace ever wondered what a Roman slave

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,239
and a prince born in Nepal might agree

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,440
on you know it's funny how life

16
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,199
sometimes brings together the most

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,039
unlikely pairs like peanut butter and

18
00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:00,519
jelly or in this case a Roman slave and

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,840
an Indian prince who would have thought

20
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:06,080
could epicus be the stoic Buddha in this

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,799
video we'll explore the wisdom shared by

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,119
epicus and the Buddha we'll discover how

23
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,000
epictetus's stoic principles can serve

24
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,960
as a bridge for westerners to better

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,720
understand and appreciate Buddhist

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,799
teachings and how both Traditions offer

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,880
practical guidance for navigating life's

28
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,159
challenges with greater Clarity

29
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,600
resilience and

30
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,680
equinity as we compare the teachings of

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,920
these two great minds we find a wisdom

32
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,200
that is is timeless and

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,680
Universal their insights into desire

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,000
mental discipline and inner peace are

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,240
just as applicable today as they were

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,320
centuries

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,680
ago the eastwest

38
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,840
divide the notion of an unbridgeable

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,799
Chasm separating eastern and western

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,200
thought has long been a common

41
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:57,600
assumption westerners often point to

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,479
towering intellects like Socrates Plato

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,240
and Aristotle celebrating their emphasis

44
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,280
on reason logic and the Relentless

45
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,280
pursuit of knowledge the east in turn is

46
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,000
frequently characterized by its Rich

47
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,319
spiritual Traditions with Buddhism taism

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,920
and Hinduism all placing great emphasis

49
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,360
on intuition mindfulness and the

50
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,519
cultivation of inner

51
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,400
wisdom rard Kipling once wrote East is

52
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:27,280
East and West is West and never the

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,280
twain shall meet but what if I told you

54
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,080
that Kipling's geography teacher got it

55
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,879
wrong let's see how epicus and the

56
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,159
Buddha challenged this

57
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:41,800
notion this presumed dichotomy has led

58
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,959
many to conclude that the teachings of

59
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,440
eastern and western thinkers are

60
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,959
fundamentally

61
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,680
incompatible with little insight to

62
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:55,080
offer one another the wisdom of the

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:58,280
Buddha some might argue has no place in

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,920
the intellectual discourse of the West

65
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,879
while the logical arguments of Greek

66
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,799
philosophers seem ill suited to the

67
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,799
introspective practices of the

68
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:13,200
East however as we examine the lives and

69
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:17,599
ideas of epicus and the Buddha this

70
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:20,680
stark eastwest contrast begins to break

71
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,080
down their teachings reveal a shared

72
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,519
understanding of the human condition

73
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,799
that transcends cultural and Geographic

74
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,519
boundaries suggesting that the perceived

75
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,040
divide between eastern and western

76
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,360
thought thought may be more a product of

77
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,599
our own preconceptions than a reflection

78
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,599
of

79
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:45,400
reality slave and sage epicus and the

80
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,120
Buddha though separated by centuries and

81
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,400
cultures epicus and the Buddha shared a

82
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,319
journey from hardship to

83
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,879
wisdom epicus started as a slave in

84
00:03:53,319 --> 00:04:00,159
ancient Rome while sidartha gatama the

85
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,720
future Buddha was born a prince in nepo

86
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,879
all despite their different Beginnings

87
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,640
both underwent profound transformations

88
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,040
to become two of history's most

89
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,120
influential

90
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,000
thinkers epicus whose very name means

91
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,120
acquired in Greek spent much of his

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,759
early life as the property of a wealthy

93
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,079
Roman Freedman yet even in the face of

94
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:24,360
the immense challenges and indignities

95
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,720
of slavery epicus discovered a path to

96
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,199
Inner Freedom through the study of stoic

97
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,320
philosophy he learned that true Liberty

98
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,560
lay not in external

99
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,720
circumstances but in one's ability to

100
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,800
master one's own mind and

101
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,440
emotions epicus once said it is

102
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,960
difficulties that show what men are

103
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,800
discourses

104
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,639
1.4.1 his own challenges as a slave

105
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,039
undoubtedly shaped his philosophy and

106
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:55,919
his emphasis on inner Freedom the Buddha

107
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:59,039
born sedara Gama lived a life of luxury

108
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:02,919
and ease as a young prince shielded from

109
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:05,759
the reality of human suffering however a

110
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:08,440
series of encounters with an old man a

111
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,800
sick man a corpse and a Wandering

112
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,560
aesthetic sparked a profound spiritual

113
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,320
crisis determined to find a solution to

114
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,479
the problem of suffering sidarthur

115
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,960
renounced his royal title and set out on

116
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:24,600
a path of aestheticism and

117
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,720
meditation both epicus and the Buddha

118
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,160
ultimately found Liberation through the

119
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,000
power of their own minds epicus

120
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,080
though he remained a slave for much of

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,600
his life discovered that true Freedom

122
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,120
lay in the cultivation of wisdom and

123
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,560
virtue the Buddha after years of

124
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,160
struggle and searching attained

125
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,120
Enlightenment under the bod tree

126
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,840
realizing the true nature of the mind

127
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,840
and the path to the cessation of

128
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,600
suffering Divergence and

129
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,600
Confluence epicus and the Buddha despite

130
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,560
their shared insights into The Human

131
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,560
Condition came came from different

132
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,280
philosophical and cultural

133
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,000
backgrounds stoicism epictetus's school

134
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,120
of thought is a Greek philosophy that

135
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,479
stresses reason logic and living in

136
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,720
harmony with

137
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,720
nature Buddhism on the other hand

138
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,840
originated in India and centers on the

139
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,360
nature of the Mind the roots of

140
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,560
suffering and the path to spiritual

141
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,199
Freedom stoic and Buddhist thoughts

142
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,039
differ in their metaphysical beliefs

143
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:35,120
stoics see the universe as a single

144
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:37,960
Divine entity governed by rational logos

145
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,800
while Buddhists emphasize impermanence

146
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,039
and reject the idea of a Supreme

147
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,080
Being I guess you could say that for

148
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,160
stoics the glass is half full with

149
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,360
Divine reason while for Buddhists the

150
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,880
glass is just a temporary vessel bound

151
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,560
to break someday but hey at least they

152
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,879
both agree that getting too attach to

153
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,199
the glass is a recipe for

154
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,800
disappointment yet despite these

155
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,720
different

156
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,039
epicus and the Buddha converged in their

157
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,039
understanding of the fundamental

158
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:11,360
challenges of human existence both

159
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,280
recognized the suffering that arises

160
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,840
from attachment to impermanent things

161
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,879
and the futility of seeking happiness in

162
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,759
external

163
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,919
circumstances they taught that true

164
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:24,560
peace and contentment can only be found

165
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:27,120
within through the cultivation of wisdom

166
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,120
self-discipline and

167
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,440
attachment in their teachings on the

168
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,560
nature of of Desire epic tetus and the

169
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,360
Buddha offer strikingly similar advice

170
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,240
both stress the significance of

171
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,240
distinguishing between what we can and

172
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,080
cannot control and focusing our energy

173
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,199
on the former they told us to let go of

174
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,280
our attachments to external outcomes and

175
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,840
cultivate inner contentment recognizing

176
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,840
that true happiness comes from

177
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,680
within governing desire skillful and

178
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,800
unskillful cognition

179
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,879
Central to the teachings of epicus and

180
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,280
the Buddha is the idea that our desires

181
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,159
and thoughts have a profound impact on

182
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,840
our happiness and

183
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:13,840
well-being both thinkers recognize that

184
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,280
not all desires are created equal and

185
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,639
that learning to distinguish between

186
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,280
skillful and unskillful desires is

187
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:23,919
essential to finding inner peace and

188
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,520
contentment the Buddha taught desire is

189
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:30,919
the root of suffering dapada

190
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:34,000
359 he recognized that our cravings and

191
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:36,200
aversions are often the source of our

192
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,200
discontent in Buddhist thought the term

193
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,240
tanha is often used to describe the kind

194
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,680
of craving or thirst that leads to

195
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,080
suffering but as the Buddhist scholar

196
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,600
Robert Morrison points out tanha is not

197
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,839
a condemnation of all desire but rather

198
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,279
a recognition of the fundamental human

199
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,120
condition of dissatisfaction that arises

200
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,760
from attachment to impermanent things

201
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,720
the Buddha explained that by learning to

202
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:04,399
recognize and and let go of unskillful

203
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,360
desires we can find Freedom from

204
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,519
suffering the same epicus taught that

205
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,560
our desires should be grounded in reason

206
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,720
and virtue rather than in the pursuit of

207
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,320
external Pleasures or

208
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,320
rewards he counseled his students to

209
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,800
focus their efforts on what is within

210
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,279
their control such as their own thoughts

211
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,839
and actions rather than on things

212
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,160
outside their control such as the

213
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,760
opinions of others or the vagaries of

214
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,880
Fortune

215
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,160
by cultivating wisdom and

216
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,760
self-discipline epic tetus believed that

217
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,200
we can learn to govern our desires and

218
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,640
find true

219
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,839
contentment epicus and the Buddha

220
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:46,240
acknowledged that cultivating skillful

221
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:49,320
desire and wise cognition is challenging

222
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,240
it demands persistent mindfulness

223
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,079
introspection and a Readiness to

224
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,880
confront our ingrained thought and

225
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:57,959
behavior patterns nevertheless both

226
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,920
philosophers provided practical methods

227
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:02,600
and tools for developing wisd wisdom and

228
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,320
inner peace such as the stoic practice

229
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,000
of

230
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,160
self-examination and the Buddhist

231
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,160
mindfulness of breathing

232
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,760
meditation bhist skillfulness and epican

233
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,000
internals one of the most striking

234
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,519
parallels between the teachings of

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,040
epicus and the Buddha lies in their

236
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,839
emphasis on the importance of

237
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,440
distinguishing between what is within

238
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:31,839
our control and what is not for epicus

239
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:35,639
this distinction was encapsulated in the

240
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,079
concept of internals and externals the

241
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:38,839
idea that our thoughts beliefs and

242
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:40,560
actions are within our power while

243
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,720
external events and the opinions of

244
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,279
others are ultimately beyond our control

245
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,320
epic tetus reminds us the chief task in

246
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:51,240
life is simply this to identify and

247
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,200
separate matters so that I can say

248
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,079
clearly to myself which are externals

249
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:01,079
not under my control and which have to

250
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:02,800
do with the choices I actually control

251
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,839
discourses

252
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,920
2.5.4 to

253
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:10,680
5 epic T is said that by focusing our

254
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,639
efforts on what is within our control we

255
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,560
can cultivate inner peace and Equanimity

256
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,839
even in the face of life's challenges

257
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,160
and

258
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:21,240
uncertainties he advised his students to

259
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,000
let go of their attachment to external

260
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:28,240
outcomes and instead focus on developing

261
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,560
wisdom virtue and self-mastery

262
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,680
epicus believed that we can become truly

263
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,800
free even if our external circumstances

264
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,079
remain

265
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,160
unchanged equally the Buddha taught that

266
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,839
true happiness and Liberation come from

267
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,360
within rather than from external

268
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,320
sources he emphasized the importance of

269
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,760
cultivating skillful mental States and

270
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,040
letting go of unskillful ones such as

271
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,920
greed hatred and delusion by developing

272
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,639
mindfulness compassion and wisdom the

273
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,320
Buddha believed that we can free

274
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,880
ourselves from the cycle of of suffering

275
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,040
and find lasting peace and

276
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,399
happiness the parallels between

277
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,480
epictetus's concept of internals and the

278
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:12,160
Buddha's emphasis on skillful mental

279
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,240
states are striking both thinkers

280
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,279
recognize that our happiness and

281
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,760
well-being ultimately depend on our own

282
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,639
minds rather than on external

283
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,079
circumstances they taught that by

284
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:29,760
cultivating inner peace wisdom and

285
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,519
self-discipline we can find Freedom

286
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,880
and

287
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,760
contentment even in the face of life's

288
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,760
challenges and

289
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,519
uncertainties the inward

290
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,079
turn epicus and the Buddha recognize

291
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,199
that the path to inner peace and

292
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,880
happiness begins with an inward turn a

293
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:52,800
shift in focus from the external world

294
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,399
to the inner landscape of our own

295
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,800
minds they taught that by cultivating

296
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,920
self-awareness introspection and mental

297
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,880
discipline we can begin to free

298
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,680
ourselves from the tyranny of our own

299
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,240
thoughts and emotions for epicus this

300
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,040
inward turn was encapsulated in the idea

301
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:13,120
of focusing on what is within our

302
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:17,079
control our own thoughts beliefs and

303
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,199
actions as explained just before epicus

304
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:23,519
believed that we can find true freedom

305
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:25,320
and happiness regardless of our external

306
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,360
circumstances it's like when you're

307
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,240
lying in bed at night and suddenly your

308
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,120
mind starts replaying that embarrassing

309
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,199
in thing you said in fifth grade epic

310
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,240
tetus and the Buddha would be the first

311
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:39,120
to tell you hey that's not in your

312
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,480
control anymore let it go and focus on

313
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,199
the

314
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,040
present in the same way the Buddha

315
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,360
taught that the key to Liberation from

316
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,320
suffering lies in understanding the

317
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,079
nature of our own

318
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,839
minds he encouraged his followers to

319
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:57,880
cultivate mindfulness to observe their

320
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,759
thoughts and emotions with Detachment

321
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,759
and clarity and to let go of unhealthy

322
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:06,000
mental States like craving and

323
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,800
aversion through this practice of

324
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,040
self-awareness and mental discipline the

325
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,959
Buddha believ that we can begin to see

326
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,839
through the illusions of the self and

327
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,440
find true Peace and Freedom both epicus

328
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,360
and the Buddha recognize that this

329
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,800
inward turn is not always easy it

330
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,600
requires courage honesty and a

331
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,120
willingness to confront the darker

332
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,160
aspects of our own minds yet both things

333
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,720
thinkers also emphasized that the

334
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,720
rewards of this inner work are

335
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:41,040
immeasurable a deeper sense of Peace

336
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,040
purpose and connection to ourselves and

337
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,639
others as we've explored the teachings

338
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,279
of epicus and the Buddha we've seen that

339
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,920
these two great thinkers though

340
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,839
separated by time and culture shared a

341
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,519
profound understanding of The Human

342
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:00,040
Condition both recognized that the path

343
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,199
to inner peace and happiness lies not in

344
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,480
external

345
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:06,279
circumstances but in the cultivation of

346
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,720
wisdom self-discipline and mental

347
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:12,079
clarity as the Buddha said Peace comes

348
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,880
from within do not seek it without

349
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:18,040
dapada

350
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,639
154 epicus echoed this sentiment when he

351
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,839
wrote it is not events that disturb

352
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,920
people it is their judgments concerning

353
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:28,800
them and cidian 5 their wisdom reminds

354
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,480
us that true happiness and peace lie

355
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,399
with within our own minds and hearts

356
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,199
comparing stoic and Buddhist thought

357
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,720
helps us Bridge the apparent divide

358
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,759
between eastern and western

359
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,120
traditions we can see that the

360
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:45,519
fundamental challenges of The Human

361
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,680
Experience the desire for happiness the

362
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,959
struggle with suffering the search for

363
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,959
meaning and purpose transcend cultural

364
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:54,360
and historical

365
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:57,160
boundaries in the teachings of epicus

366
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,720
and the Buddha we find a Timeless wisdom

367
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,920
that speaks to the heart of The Human

368
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,920
Condition

369
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:07,319
take the wisdom of epicus and the Buddha

370
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,319
into your life observe your thoughts and

371
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:12,600
emotions mindfully and clearly notice

372
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:16,199
when you fall into unhealthy patterns of

373
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:20,880
Desire or aversion and practice Letting

374
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:25,319
Go cultivate gratitude compassion and

375
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,319
equinity and watch your inner World

376
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,240
transform the journey toward inner peace

377
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,040
and happiness is is an ongoing process

378
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,480
not a final

379
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,880
destination it requires patience

380
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,600
