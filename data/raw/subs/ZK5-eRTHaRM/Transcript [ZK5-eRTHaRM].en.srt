1
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,750
life hurts we all feel it breakups

2
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,666
illness loss

3
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:15,583
loneliness even death

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,916
and here's Buddha saying

5
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:19,791
hey guess what

6
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,291
life is suffering

7
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,166
thanks Buddha

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,125
real uplifting message there

9
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,083
but wait if that's true

10
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,625
what's the point of all this

11
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,000
why even try

12
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,416
why get out of bed in the morning

13
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,250
if we're trapped in an endless cycle of rebirth

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,375
and suffering what's the purpose of existence

15
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,958
that's the question that kept me awake at 3:00am

16
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,291
and I'm betting it's crossed your mind too

17
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,000
hey everyone Matt here from Buddha's wisdom

18
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,625
some of you might remember our video

19
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:51,791
about the meaning of life

20
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,625
where we explored the big picture of meaning

21
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:57,583
through Buddhism's lens but today we're going deeper

22
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,333
today is different

23
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,500
today I want to explore this question honestly

24
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,458
because I struggled with it for years

25
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:05,791
when I finally understood

26
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,083
what Buddha was really saying about life's meaning

27
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,583
it wasn't what I expected

28
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,625
but it changed how I see everything

29
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,458
the meaning of life according to Buddhism

30
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,000
isn't some secret formula or distant goal

31
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:18,958
it's something both simpler

32
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:21,416
and more eye opening than most of us realize

33
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:22,625
and I think you'll be

34
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,000
surprised by what it reveals about your own life

35
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,125
let's start with a question

36
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,250
when was the last time you thought

37
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:33,958
I'll be happy

38
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:37,125
when I'll be happy when I get that promotion

39
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,041
when I find the right relationship

40
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,625
when I finally lose those 15 pounds

41
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,375
when I have enough money

42
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:47,208
I used to do this all the time one day

43
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,583
I caught myself thinking

44
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,208
I'll be happy when I understand Buddhism better

45
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,708
and then I realized the irony

46
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,666
I was using Buddha's teachings

47
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,291
as another happiness trap

48
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:00,500
here's what most people get wrong about Buddha's first

49
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,458
noble truth

50
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,000
when he said life is suffering

51
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,625
he wasn't being a downer

52
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,166
the Pali word dukkha doesn't just mean suffering

53
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,166
it means unsatisfactoriness

54
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,166
that feeling that something's always a little off

55
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:15,416
remember last month

56
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,916
when you finally got that thing you wanted so badly

57
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,583
that iPhone with the killer camera

58
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:21,708
that date

59
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,083
with the person whose Instagram you've been stalking

60
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,125
that job offer with the fancy title

61
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,625
how long did that happiness last

62
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,750
before you started wanting something else

63
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,166
three days a week

64
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,916
until the next iOS update or LinkedIn notification

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,041
exactly

66
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,583
I had this brutal realization few years ago

67
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,041
after a breakup I was devastated

68
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,500
lying on my apartment floor at night

69
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,916
crying into a cold pepperoni pizza

70
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,000
scrolling through our vacation photos

71
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,500
wondering how I'd ever feel okay again

72
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:59,125
classic rock bottom right

73
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,791
but in that moment something clicked

74
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,083
I realized

75
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,208
I'd been treating happiness like some destination

76
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,541
I'd eventually reach if I just checked enough boxes

77
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,083
on life's scavenger hunt

78
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,875
Buddha saw this trap 2,500 years ago

79
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,500
we're wired to want things

80
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,000
get them and then immediately want more

81
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,125
it's like we're hamsters on a wheel

82
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,625
running and running but never getting anywhere

83
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,666
the happiness trap keeps us stuck in this cycle

84
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,833
always chasing but never arriving

85
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,916
so if life is just an endless series of desires

86
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,666
that never fully satisfy us

87
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,833
what's the point why keep running on the wheel

88
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,458
that's where many people walk away from Buddhist

89
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,041
teachings they think

90
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,375
well if everything leads to suffering

91
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,166
then nothing matters but that's where they're wrong

92
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,291
and where things get really interesting

93
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,750
the happiness trap isn't just about chasing pleasure

94
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,125
it's about misunderstanding

95
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,458
what makes life meaningful in the first place

96
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,666
and the path out of this trap

97
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,458
leads us to another bizarre paradox of Buddhism

98
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,750
that most people completely miss

99
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,125
have you ever played a video game

100
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,625
that's impossible to win

101
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,166
that's what seeking enlightenment can feel like

102
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,125
sometimes when I first got into Buddhism

103
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,875
I had this image in my head

104
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,291
me sitting cross legged on a mountain

105
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,708
perfectly serene

106
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:25,000
problems just bouncing off my enlightened force field

107
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,125
I'd finally made it

108
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,208
but after years of practice and study

109
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,166
I realized something uncomfortable

110
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,583
I was playing an impossible game

111
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,833
let me explain in our video

112
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,916
8 steps to Nirvana to Reach Peace

113
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,208
we talked about the Noble Eightfold Path

114
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,291
Buddha's roadmap to enlightenment

115
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,208
but there's something I didn't fully explain then

116
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,666
these eight steps they're not like a checklist

117
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,000
you complete once and then you're done

118
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,250
they're not even like stairs you climb to reach the top

119
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,208
they're more like instruments in an orchestra

120
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,791
you need to keep playing simultaneously forever

121
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,250
I remember the day this hit me

122
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,208
I was at a silent meditation retreat

123
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,041
feeling pretty good about my practice

124
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,750
three whole days without checking Twitter

125
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,250
practically a bodhisattva right

126
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,250
then I lost my phone

127
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:18,625
within seconds

128
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,375
I went from spiritual practitioner to frantic guy

129
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,625
turning over every cushion in the meditation hall

130
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,958
and accusing the monk in the corner of theft

131
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,416
my Zen face replaced by panic

132
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,208
sweating

133
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,500
so much for my progress right

134
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,791
my teacher just laughed

135
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,625
when I confessed how upset I'd gotten

136
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,250
he said did you think enlightenment meant never feeling

137
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,416
frustrated again

138
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,750
that's not freedom that's emotional numbness

139
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,583
he shared a quote from Zen master Shunryu Suzuki

140
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:54,166
not the enlightened self not the perfect self

141
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,125
just yourself

142
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,000
right now

143
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,750
this was a total game changer for me

144
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,500
I'd been striving for this perfect end state

145
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,083
this graduation day when I'd finally get it and be done

146
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,000
but that's not how it works

147
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,500
the Buddha himself said the way is not in the sky

148
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,875
the way is in the heart

149
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,208
he wasn't talking about some distant destination

150
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,333
he was talking about how we meet this moment right here

151
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,208
so if enlightenment isn't a finish line

152
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,250
if Nirvana isn't some trophy we eventually earn

153
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,416
what's the point of all this effort

154
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,416
why meditate why practice

155
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,375
why try to live ethically if we're never done

156
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,958
the answer completely changed my understanding

157
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,958
of what Buddhism is actually about

158
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,916
so if we can't escape suffering completely

159
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,041
and enlightenment isn't some medal we earn

160
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,041
what exactly is the point

161
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,750
this was the question that kept me up at night

162
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,833
and the answer I found changed everything

163
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,166
Buddhism has a secret weapon

164
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,583
that transforms how we experience suffering

165
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,875
it's not meditation though

166
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:05,666
that helps

167
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,791
it's not detachment

168
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,916
though that's part of it

169
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,666
it's something much simpler and more powerful

170
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,791
compassion

171
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,333
I used to think

172
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,500
compassion was just being nice to people

173
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,166
hold doors open donate to charity

174
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,875
basic good person stuff but Buddhist compassion

175
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,000
what they call Karuna goes way deeper

176
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,250
let me get personal for a minute

177
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,791
last year my mom got sick

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,500
really sick I moved back home to help care for her

179
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,208
feeding her soup she could barely swallow

180
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,375
helping her to the bathroom at 3:00am

181
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,916
watching her hands tremble

182
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,000
as she tried to hold a glass of water

183
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,583
the antiseptic smell of the house

184
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,083
the constant beeping of medication reminders

185
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,125
the hushed phone calls with doctors

186
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,625
it was brutal there was so much suffering

187
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,333
hers and mine

188
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,625
one night exhausted and feeling sorry for myself

189
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,000
I remembered something from the Dalai Lama

190
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,583
it sounded nice but honestly

191
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,750
in that moment it felt like some greeting card nonsense

192
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,958
how would compassion help either of us

193
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,625
but I tried something

194
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,375
instead of seeing my mom's situation

195
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,708
as this horrible thing happening to both of us

196
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,791
I started seeing it as an opportunity to express love

197
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,500
the same tasks helping her eat

198
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,625
helping her walk but with a different intention

199
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,541
everything looked different

200
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,416
the suffering didn't disappear

201
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,875
my back still ached from lifting her

202
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,875
I still woke up exhausted

203
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,791
she still had bad days but it had meaning now

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
it wasn't pointless pain it was love made visible

205
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,125
those moments holding her hand while she slept

206
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,916
weren't just duties to endure

207
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,458
they became the most

208
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,666
important meditation I'd ever practiced

209
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,041
Buddha understood

210
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,458
something fundamental about human psychology

211
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,000
when we focus only on our own happiness

212
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,500
life can feel empty and pointless

213
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,291
but when we connect with others

214
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,958
when we make alleviating suffering our purpose

215
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,958
meaning appears naturally

216
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,041
Buddha taught that our purpose emerges naturally

217
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,250
when we align our actions with compassion

218
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,875
and mindfulness for many of us

219
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,416
this purpose reveals itself

220
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,541
through connecting with others

221
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,875
and alleviating suffering where we can

222
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,166
but here's where we often go wrong

223
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,666
especially in the west

224
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,291
we try to find meaning in the wrong places

225
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:38,916
in the west

226
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,791
we're obsessed with finding our purpose or life calling

227
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:42,791
it's like

228
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,583
we're all waiting for this lightning bolt moment

229
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,541
where suddenly everything makes sense

230
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,666
follow your passion find your purpose

231
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:53,625
discover your why I spent years jumping from job to job

232
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,375
relationship to relationship

233
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,125
even spiritual practice to spiritual practice

234
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,375
always searching for that perfect fit

235
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,958
that thing that would finally make me say

236
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,541
this is it

237
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,541
this is what I was put on earth to do

238
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,458
ring any bells

239
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,500
here's the problem

240
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,333
Buddha would say we've got it backwards

241
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:14,708
the Dhammapada

242
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,916
teaches us about the importance of putting our full

243
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,000
attention and effort into our actions

244
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,458
but the key insight isn't finding the perfect work

245
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,916
it's giving your heart to whatever is in front of you

246
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,916
I learned this lesson in the most unexpected place

247
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,000
washing dishes

248
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,916
during a 10 day silent retreat

249
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,625
I was assigned to dish duty

250
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,500
10 days of scrubbing other people's crusty plates

251
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,166
in silence not exactly my idea of spiritual growth

252
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,291
by day 3 I was miserable

253
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,541
this is not why I came here

254
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,916
I thought I should be meditating

255
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,250
gaining insights having breakthroughs

256
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,750
not washing dishes

257
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,833
on day 4 something weird happened

258
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,166
I fully gave up

259
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,666
I surrendered to the fact that for the next six days

260
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:02,541
I was just the dish guy my spiritual resume would read

261
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,208
enlightenment seeker and part time dishwasher

262
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,750
and in that surrender the world tilted on its axis

263
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,583
I started really washing those dishes

264
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,916
feeling the warm water against my skin

265
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,000
noticing the rainbow patterns swirling in soap bubbles

266
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,916
hearing the soft clink of plates being stacked

267
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,750
feeling gratitude for the calloused hands that chopped

268
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,583
and stirred and cooked the food

269
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:25,291
wishing

270
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,375
well to the people who'd eaten from these plates

271
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,500
even the guy who

272
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,125
somehow managed to get peanut butter on both sides

273
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,541
it wasn't a lightning bolt moment

274
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,166
it was quieter than that

275
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,500
but suddenly washing dishes had meaning

276
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,250
not because the task itself was important

277
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,875
but because I was fully present for it

278
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,458
the Buddha never said find your purpose

279
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,916
he said be fully present for your life as it unfolds

280
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
the western obsession with finding that one

281
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,375
perfect purpose

282
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,500
keeps us always looking toward the future

283
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,291
missing the meaning that's available right now

284
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,625
this completely contradicts

285
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,208
how most of us think about meaning

286
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,208
and purpose

287
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:07,375
we think meaning comes from doing extraordinary things

288
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,250
starting a billion dollar company

289
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,250
getting a million followers

290
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,250
having our face on a billboard

291
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,125
but what if the most meaningful

292
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,333
life comes from bringing extraordinary presence

293
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,625
to ordinary things what if your morning commute

294
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,916
that boring team meeting or folding laundry

295
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,916
could be just as meaningful as summiting Everest

296
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:31,083
this leads us to the most counterintuitive truth of all

297
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:36,750
what if I told you

298
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,375
the most meaningful life might come from

299
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,208
stopping the search for meaning entirely

300
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,000
stay with me here

301
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,166
this is where things get weird and profound

302
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:46,833
remember those moments

303
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,666
when you were so absorbed in something

304
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,458
maybe playing music or hiking in nature

305
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,625
or deep in conversation with a friend

306
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,625
that you completely forgot yourself

307
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,125
time disappeared your problems vanished

308
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,375
and you were just there

309
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,833
those moments of flow of complete presence

310
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,958
that's what Buddhism is pointing toward

311
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,000
not some grand purpose

312
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,500
that makes your life significant in the cosmic scheme

313
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,333
but the simple miracle of being fully alive

314
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,291
in this moment

315
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,500
Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh said

316
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,666
the miracle is not to walk on water

317
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,083
the miracle is to walk on the green earth

318
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,916
dwelling deeply in the present moment

319
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,041
and feeling truly alive

320
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,625
I had this experience last summer on a camping trip

321
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,500
I was sitting by the lake at sunset

322
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,916
just watching the colors change on the water

323
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,333
nothing special

324
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,625
but suddenly I wasn't watching the sunset

325
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,000
I was the sunset

326
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:47,291
the boundary between me and the world just dissolved

327
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,291
for those few minutes there was no Matt

328
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,250
trying to figure out the point of his life

329
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,125
there was just life happening

330
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,458
and it was enough

331
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,291
Buddhist teacher Jack Cornfield reminds us

332
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,625
the trouble is you think you have time

333
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,208
we're constantly postponing our lives

334
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,083
waiting for meaning to arrive

335
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,875
waiting to figure it all out

336
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,500
but life is happening now

337
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,958
while we're making other plans

338
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,750
when we stop demanding that life have some grand

339
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,375
purpose something paradoxical happens

340
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,541
we find ourselves naturally drawn to what matters

341
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,666
we stop asking what's the point and start asking

342
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,125
what's needed here

343
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,708
how can I help what wants to come through me

344
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,000
the Japanese concept of ikigai

345
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,666
your reason for being

346
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,500
isn't something you discover once and for all

347
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,916
it's something you practice daily

348
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,791
through the way you engage with your ordinary life

349
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,916
this isn't giving up it's not nihilism

350
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,708
it's actually the most engaged way to live

351
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,791
when we stop treating life like a problem to solve

352
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:57,666
or a test to pass we can finally show up for it fully

353
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,333
and that brings us to

354
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,500
the ultimate plot twist in Buddha's teachings

355
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,000
so what is the meaning of life according to Buddha

356
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,041
ready for the plot twist there isn't one fixed meaning

357
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,000
and that's actually the good news

358
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,000
in our video Buddha's Emptiness explained

359
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,750
we talked about how nothing has inherent fixed meaning

360
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,500
and while that might sound depressing at first

361
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,625
it's actually incredibly liberating

362
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,458
life doesn't come with meaning pre installed

363
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,458
we create meaning through how we live

364
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,791
through our choices our connections

365
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:33,750
our presence

366
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,208
here's the radical truth Buddha was pointing to

367
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,541
life isn't meaningful because of what we achieve

368
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,666
or accumulate

369
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,750
it's meaningful because we're here to experience it

370
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,958
to taste it to feel it

371
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,500
to connect through it

372
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,041
the meaning isn't in reaching Nirvana someday

373
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,000
the meaning is in how you walk the path today

374
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,333
I remember asking my teacher

375
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,208
but what's the point

376
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,000
if we're all just going to die anyway

377
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,666
she laughed and said Matt

378
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,958
do you only eat pizza if it lasts forever

379
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,000
do you refuse to watch Netflix

380
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,041
because the series will eventually end

381
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,916
do you avoid falling in love

382
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,833
because all relationships change

383
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,291
your question is like deleting Spotify

384
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,583
because songs have endings

385
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,041
the point is the experience itself

386
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,166
the taste the sound

387
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,250
the feeling

388
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,666
the point is being fully here for whatever is happening

389
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,458
even if it's just washing those dishes

390
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,750
we talked about earlier

391
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,916
Buddhism isn't about escaping life

392
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,083
it's about showing up for it completely pain

393
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,000
joy boredom

394
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,208
excitement all of it

395
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,875
it's about bringing your full

396
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,166
attention to whatever is happening right now

397
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,416
the 4 Noble truths aren't a pessimistic declaration

398
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,666
that life is suffering

399
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,666
they're a realistic acknowledgement

400
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,541
that life contains suffering

401
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,666
and a practical path to transforming our relationship

402
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,791
with that suffering

403
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,708
the meaning of life

404
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,958
isn't something to figure out intellectually

405
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,625
it's something to embody through how we live

406
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,333
so if you're still wondering what the point of life is

407
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,291
maybe try asking a different question

408
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,000
instead of what's the point

409
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,833
ask what's possible right now

410
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,000
how can I be fully here for this one

411
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,708
precious moment that will never come again

412
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,250
because that's what Buddha was really pointing to

413
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,000
not some distant enlightenment

414
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,791
but the immediate freedom available

415
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,500
when we stop chasing stop resisting

416
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,333
and simply show up for our lives as they are

417
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,333
that's the ultimate meaning

418
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,875
not something we find

419
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,750
but something we create moment by moment

420
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,583
through the quality of our attention

421
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,333
and the openness of our hearts

422
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:47,000
for me that means spending less time doomscrolling

423
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and more time actually

424
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,250
looking into the eyes of people I'm talking to

425
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,291
it means tasting my food

426
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,458
instead of inhaling it while watching YouTube

427
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,750
it means feeling the sun on my skin

428
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,541
and remembering that someday

429
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,791
this ordinary Tuesday

430
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,916
might be the day I look back on and think

431
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,625
that was life that was it

432
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,208
picture yourself years from now

433
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,666
looking back at this moment

434
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,791
not at your achievements or possessions

435
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,916
but at how fully you lived each ordinary day

436
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:14,625
the mornings

437
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,250
you noticed the steam rising from your coffee cup

438
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,958
the times you really listened to a friend

439
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,875
instead of planning what to say next

440
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,916
the walks where you felt your feet touching the earth

441
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,750
that's the real miracle not escaping life

442
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,833
but being fully here for it

443
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,500

448
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,416
and remember the point of life isn't to avoid suffering

449
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,958
it's to be fully alive in each moment

450
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,708
whatever that moment brings

451
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,375
until next time this is Matt from Buddha's wisdom

452
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,958
wishing you a life of meaning

453
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,958
not because it's significant in some cosmic way

454
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,083
but because you're fully present for it
