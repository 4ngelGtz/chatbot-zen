2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,600
struggled to accept the person staring

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,360
back at you have you ever felt like

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,090
you're not enough despite your best

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,240
efforts and

00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,440
[Music]

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,400

00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,359
Seekers It's Peter from Buddha's wisdom

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,439
and today I want to dive deep into a

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,519
topic that's close to my heart Learning

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,039
To Love

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,119
Yourself I've broken this down into four

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,079
key lessons that have transformed my own

14
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:34,640
journey of self-discovery and our

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,680
growth first things first let's talk

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,160
about the labels we put on

17
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,280
ourselves I used to be guilty of this

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,520
myself constantly defining Myself by my

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,280
mistakes weaknesses and perceived

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,480
shortcomings but here's the thing these

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,960
labels are just Stories We Tell

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,079
ourselves and we have the power to

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,280
rewrite

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,399
them when you catch yourself thinking

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,119
I'm not good enough or I'll never ch

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,840
change remember that these are just

27
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,360
thoughts not reality you are so much

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,320
more than your labels and you have the

29
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,320
capacity to grow and evolve Beyond

30
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:18,320
[Music]

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,119
them next step let's talk about mistakes

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,320
I know it's a tough one we've all been

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,759
there beating ourselves up over every

34
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,400
little misstep or failure but here's the

35
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,360
secret mistakes are actually a sign that

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,680
you're trying that you're not giving up

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,479
on yourself think about it every

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,360
successful person out there has made

39
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:40,600
countless mistakes along the way the key

40
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,680
is to learn from them to use them as

41
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,560
stepping stones to growth and

42
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,799
self-discovery when you accept your

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,119
mistakes as part of the journey you free

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,380
yourself from the burden of perfection

45
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,010
and open yourself up to Endless

46
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,960

[Laughter]

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,280
Possibilities now let's address the

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,799
inner critic you know that voice in your

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,320
head that's all always quick to point

51
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,600
out your flaws and

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,000
shortcomings it's time to have a serious

53
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,039
talk with that voice negative

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,599
self-criticism is like a weed that

55
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,879
chokes out the beautiful garden of

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,599
self-love every time you criticize

57
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:18,400
yourself you're reinforcing the belief

58
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,599
that you're not worthy of love and

59
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,840
respect but here's the

60
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:27,519
