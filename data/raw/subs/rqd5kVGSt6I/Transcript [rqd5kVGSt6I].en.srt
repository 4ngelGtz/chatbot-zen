00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,519
let that sink in for a

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,960
sec

26
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:05,840
now I know what you're thinking that's

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,200
it that's the big life-changing quote

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,640
but hold up my skeptical friend we're

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,280
just getting

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,360
started first off let's break down that

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,680
first part what you think you become

32
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,280
it's like the Buddha was reading our

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,920
minds am I right I mean have you ever

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,400
noticed how your thoughts have a sneaky

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,880
way of shaping your reality it's like

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,640
that time you convinced yourself you

37
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,920
were going to bomb that job interview

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,680
and then you actually

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,240
did coincidence I think not but here's

40
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,799
the cool part you can totally flip the

41
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,360
script and start thinking your way to a

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,399
brighter future it's all about training

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,079
your brain to focus on the good stuff so

44
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,439
instead of dwelling on that embarrassing

45
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,920
moment from seventh grade we've all been

46
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,640
there try picturing yourself crushing

47
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,840
your goals and living your best life

48
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,840
trust me it

49
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,960
works next up we've got what you feel

50
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,759
you attract now I'm not saying you

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,880
should go around feeling blessed 24/7

52
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,560
although that would be dope but the

53
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,399
Buddha was definitely on to something

54
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,680
when he dropped this truth bomb think

55
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,440
about it when you're radiating Good

56
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,040
Vibes good things just seem to find you

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,080
it's like the universe is giving you a

58
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,040
cosmic high five on the flip side when

59
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,920
you're drowning in negative emotions

60
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,840
it's like you're a magnet for all things

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,319
sucky so how do you break the cycle it's

62
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,959
all about learning to ride the waves of

63
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,840
your emotions without getting swept away

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,959
take a deep breath acknowledge what

65
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,810
you're feeling and then Let It Go like a

66
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,440
bad habit trust me it gets easier with

67
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,360

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,440
top what you imagine you create this is

70
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,040
where things get really juicy the Buddha

71
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,400
was basically giving us the ultimate

72
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,400
life hack the power to manifest our

73
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,360
wildest dreams just by putting our minds

74
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,239
to it now I'm not saying you can just

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,920
sit on your couch and visualize your way

76
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,959
to a mansion and a private jet although

77
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,920
if that works for you hit me up with

78
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,080
your

79
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,280
secrets but there's definitely something

80
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,120
to be said for the power of

81
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,319
imagination whether you're picturing

82
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,440
yourself nailing that presentation or

83
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,200
finally asking out your crush

84
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,159
visualization can be a

85
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,760
GameChanger it's like you're planting

86
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:24,080
Little Seeds of possibility in your mind

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,280
and with a little TLC and a lot of

88
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,280
hustle those seeds can grow into

89
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,920
something

90
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,439

your life but here's the thing it's not

93

enough to just read it and move on

94
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,080
you've got to live it breathe it and

quote that really speaks to you and

focus on incorporating it into your life

99
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,599
maybe it's being more mindful of your

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,760
thoughts or maybe it's learning to let

101
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,560
go of negative

102
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,120

103
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,200
