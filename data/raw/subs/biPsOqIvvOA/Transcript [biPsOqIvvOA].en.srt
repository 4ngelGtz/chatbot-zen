Seekers today we're diving into the

7

heart of Buddhism with a topic that

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,640
could very well change the way you

truths these truths aren't just abstract

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,240
Concepts they are the Bedrock of the

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,400
Buddha's Enlightenment offering a

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,960
transformative path out of the cycles of

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,440
dissatisfaction action and suffering

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,160
that bind us imagine for a moment living

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,680
in a state where you're merely existing

18
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,160
not truly aware of the deeper

19
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,840
undercurrents of Life repeating patterns

20
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,800
that lead to suffering without even

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,719
realizing it the Buddha likened this to

22
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,840
sleepwalking through

23
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,840
existence but there's a wakeup call and

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,120
it's called the four noble truths

25
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,120
regarded as Noble for their profound

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,879
capacity to liberate and Enlighten these

27
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,000
truths are your first step on a journey

28
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,280
journe that could lead you to Ultimate

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,320
Awakening perhaps even to becoming a

30
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,240
Buddha

31
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,479
yourself so let's awaken together and

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,479
explore these fundamental aspects of

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:17,000
reality that promise to bring wisdom

34
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:19,400
peace and Enlightenment into our

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,759
lives let's delve into the profound

36
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,840
concept of Duca often translated as

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,840
suffering but encompassing so much

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,680
more Duca represents the fundamental

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,240
unsatisfactoriness and impermanence of

40
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,119
life life the subtle undercurrent of

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,079
discontent that pervades our existence

42
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,960
from the moment we are born we are

43
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,560
subject to change Decay and eventually

44
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,960
death but Dua isn't just about these

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,079
Grand existential truths it's also found

46
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,079
in the minui of our daily lives from the

47
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,200
frustration of a traffic jam to the

48
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,520
Heartbreak of a lost love in the

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,719
teachings of the Buddha Dua is

50
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,759
categorized into three distinct types

51
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,079
the suffering of suff suffering which

52
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:06,960
includes physical and emotional pain the

53
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,959
suffering of change which refers to the

54
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,400
transient nature of our happiness and

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,560
how our Pleasures inevitably lead to

56
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,080
dissatisfaction and the all pervasive

57
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,959
suffering which is the subtle often

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,760
unnoticed stress we carry due to our

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,640
continuous quest for satisfaction in a

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,920
world that is inherently unable to

61
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,400
provide lasting contentment

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,959
understanding Duca is not meant to lead

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,480
us to pessimism or

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,640
despair instead it's intended to awaken

65
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,200
us to the reality of our situation and

66
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,840
to help us see more clearly the nature

67
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,959
of our

68
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,440
experiences by acknowledging the

69
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,480
presence of suffering We Begin The Path

70
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,239
towards

71
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,000
Liberation it's like diagnosing an

72
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,640
ailment the first step toward healing is

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,640
recognizing the

74
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,120
problem in the same way recognizing Dua

75
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,200
is the first step toward toward

76
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,239
Spiritual Awakening and freedom from the

77
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,040
cycles that bind us to

78
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,360
suffering so as we reflect on the first

79
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,480
Noble Truth let's approach it not as a

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,840
grim reality but as an opportunity for

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,920
profound insight and growth by

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,080
understanding the nature of Duca we

83
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,920
prepare ourselves for the journey ahead

84
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,040
a journey towards deeper wisdom

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,799
compassion and ultimately The Liberation

86
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,959
that the Buddha's teachings promise let

87
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,400
this understanding be the foundation on

88
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,920
which we build our path to Enlightenment

89
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,200
one step at a time with Buddha's wisdom

90
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,720
as your companion on this transformative

91
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,360
Journey we arrive at the second Noble

92
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,080
truth the truth of the cause of

93
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,920
suffering known as samudaya this truth

94
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,200
delves into the origins of duka offering

95
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,760
us insight into why we experience

96
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,360
suffering and how it can be perpetuated

97
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,159
by our own actions and

98
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,200
desires at the heart of samud Lies the

99
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,840
concept of tan or craving

100
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,799
which the Buddha identified as the

101
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,439
primary cause of all

102
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:09,959
suffering this craving can take many

103
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:12,439
forms the desire for sensual Pleasures

104
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:16,040
the craving for existence and becoming

105
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:18,880
or the desire for non-existence and

106
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,320
Annihilation each of these desires binds

107
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,880
us to the endless cycle of samsara The

108
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,560
Continuous cycle of birth death and

109
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,400
rebirth keeping us trapped in a loop of

110
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,880
Perpetual

111
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,120
dissatisfaction but why do We crave the

112
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,759
Buddha teaches that this is rooted in

113
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,680
ignorance a fundamental misunderstanding

114
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,960
of the nature of

115
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,440
reality we cling to ideas of permanence

116
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,280
self and satisfaction in things that are

117
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,360
impermanent not self and ultimately

118
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,520
unsatisfactory this misapprehension

119
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,199
leads us to chase after fleeting

120
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,919
Pleasures attach ourselves to identities

121
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,160
and possessions and recoil from

122
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,160
unpleasant experiences all of which only

123
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,759
serve to deepen our entanglement in the

124
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,960
web of

125
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,800
suffering understanding the second Noble

126
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Truth is a call to introspection and

127
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,759
mindfulness it invites us to look

128
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,759
closely at our desires and the

129
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,199
intentions behind our

130
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,280
actions by observing our Cravings

131
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,479
without judgment we begin to see how

132
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,080
they arise take hold and eventually lead

133
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,520
to suffering this awareness is the first

134
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,800
step towards Transforming Our

135
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,240
relationship with our desires from one

136
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,560
of blind pursuit to one of wise

137
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,240
understanding as we reflect on the

138
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,080
causes of our suffering we are

139
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,840
encouraged to cultivate a sense of

140
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,199
Detachment and

141
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,759
equinity this doesn't mean renouncing

142
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,000
Joy or denying ourselves the richness of

143
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,560
life's

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,199
experiences rather it's about engaging

145
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,400
with the world in a more mindful

146
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,440
balanced way free from the grip of

147
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,560
craving and

148
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,080
aversion through this understanding we

149
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,479
pave the way for the profound Liberation

150
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,479
that the Buddhist path offers a

151
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:01,400
Liberation not just from suffering but

152
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:03,360
but from the very causes of suffering

153
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,680
itself let's take this knowledge to

154
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,800
heart as we continue our

155
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,840
Exploration with each step on this path

156
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,360
we gain not only a deeper understanding

157
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,199
of the Buddhist teachings but also

158
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,919
practical insights into how we can lead

159
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,960
more peaceful fulfilled lives stay tuned

160
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,560
to Buddha's wisdom as we journey

161
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,039
together towards Enlightenment One Truth

162
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,720
at a

163
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:31,479
time we arrive at a pivotal point in our

164
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,479
journey the third Noble truth the truth

165
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:36,479
of the end of suffering known as neroda

166
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,280
this profound truth offers a Beacon of

167
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,360
Hope Illuminating the path towards the

168
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,680
cessation of all suffering it reveals

169
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,840
that the Relentless cycle of Duca driven

170
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,639
by craving and ignorance can indeed come

171
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,639
to an end nurota suggests that it is

172
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,360
possible to reach a state of being where

173
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:57,840
all suffering ceases where the fires of

174
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,400
craving aversion and delusion are

175
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,720
extinguished this state known as Nirvana

176
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,759
represents the ultimate Liberation a

177
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,520
freedom not from life itself but from

178
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,960
the suffering that binds us to the

179
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,800
endless cycle of

180
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,599
rebirths Nirvana is often described as

181
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,720
the highest and most profound peace an

182
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,319
unconditioned reality beyond the

183
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,639
confines of Desire time and

184
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,000
individuality but how do we realize the

185
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,280
state of neura the cessation of

186
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,240
suffering the Buddha teaches that it

187
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,759
begins with understanding with truly

188
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,680
grasping the nature of suffering and its

189
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,479
causes it requires us to let go of our

190
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,720
attachments to relinquish the very

191
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,440
