1
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:12,583
it's one of the most profound discoveries in human history

2
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:15,083
2,500 years ago

3
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:18,250
the Buddha found a revolutionary path to freedom

4
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:19,666
not through extremes

5
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,833
but through a radical new understanding

6
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,166
we all live between extremes

7
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,166
working too hard or not enough

8
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,791
wanting everything or giving up completely

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,583
holding on too tight or pushing everyone away

10
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,291
but what if there was another way

11
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,291
the story I'm about to tell you

12
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,541
begins with the Buddha's discovery

13
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,500
but it doesn't end there

14
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,916
seven hundred years later

15
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,083
a brilliant philosopher emerged

16
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,041
the one they called the Second Buddha

17
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:56,166
so influential his ideas transformed an entire religion

18
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:58,250
and so mysterious

19
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,666
legends say he Learned wisdom from mythical dragons

20
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,041
this is the story of how the Middle Way evolved

21
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,416
from a path between extremes into a revolution

22
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,166
in how we see everything

23
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,083
my name is Peter and today

24
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,250
we'll explore how this ancient wisdom

25
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,333
can transform your modern life

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,916
as we saw in our video about Siddhartha's journey

27
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,125
the Buddha discovered the middle way

28
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:32,125
after experiencing both extremes of life

29
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,500
from the luxuries of a prince

30
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,708
to the hardships of an ascetic

31
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,458
until he found a different path

32
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,958
but what happened next is equally fascinating

33
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,500
The Middle Way began in India

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,666
but it didn't stay there

35
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,666
like water flowing from a mountain peak

36
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:52,125
Buddhist wisdom spread in every direction

37
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,250
to the north it climbed the highest mountains on earth

38
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:59,500
in Tibet the Middle Way transformed monasteries

39
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,125
became centers of philosophical debate

40
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:03,291
where monks

41
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:07,500
would spend decades contemplating its deepest meanings

42
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:11,083
to the east across the Himalayas into China

43
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,166
here the Middle Way blended with Taoist wisdom

44
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,291
creating new forms of Buddhist thought

45
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,291
that would later spread to Korea and Japan

46
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,541
each culture it touched added its own understanding

47
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,666
in Tibet it became a path of deep analysis and debate

48
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,458
in China

49
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,458
it merged with practical wisdom

50
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,166
about harmony and balance

51
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,791
in the mountain kingdoms of the Himalayas

52
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,875
it shaped entire ways of life

53
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,833
during this remarkable spread of Buddhism

54
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,416
something even more profound was happening

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,125
a new understanding was emerging called Mahāyāna

56
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,416
the great vehicle

57
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,000
but what made it great?

58
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:56,875
for the first time

59
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,583
liberation wasn't just for monks and nuns

60
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,208
it wasn't just for the specially devoted

61
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,250
it was for everyone Mahāyāna taught that

62
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:11,583
we are all connected in ways we can barely imagine

63
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,125
so true liberation must include all beings

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,791
this movement emphasized

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
boundless compassion for everyone

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,083
wisdom that goes beyond words

67
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,000
and a path open to all

68
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,708
this was the world Nagarjuna was born into

69
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,208
at Nalanda University

70
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,916
where scholars from all these traditions gathered

71
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,916
in the heart of ancient India

72
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,791
a place where thousands of monks

73
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,208
from across Asia came to study

74
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,833
he saw something revolutionary

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,708
the Middle Way wasn't just a path between extremes

76
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,416
it wasn't just a meeting point of different cultures

77
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,833
it was a key to understanding reality itself

78
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,333
legend tells us

79
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,708
he retrieved sacred text from the realm of the Nagas

80
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,541
mythical serpent beings of great wisdom

81
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,166
while we can't verify these stories

82
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,875
they capture something true

83
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,208
his insights seem to come

84
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,500
from depths no one had explored before

85
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:09,291
and so

86
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,333
began a new chapter in the story of the Middle Way

87
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,333
what was Nagarjuna's revolutionary insight

88
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,708
it began with a text

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,416
”The Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way”

90
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,875
a text so fundamental

91
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,291
it still studied in monasteries today

92
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:39,416
a work so profound it opens with these mysterious words

93
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,166
what could these words mean

94
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,500
imagine holding an apple you think it's a simple thing

95
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:58,833
something solid

96
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,708
something real

97
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,666
something that exists on its own

98
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,375
but Nagarjuna asks us to look deeper

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,916
where is the apple without the tree that grew it?

100
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,833
without the sun that fed it?

101
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,250
without the rain that nourished it?

102
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,666
without the eyes that see it?

103
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,875
without the mind that names it?

104
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:27,208
through 27 chapters Nagarjuna examined reality itself

105
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,333
and what he found changed everything

106
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,875
first he showed us that the middle way

107
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,125
goes beyond just finding balance

108
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,750
in chapter 1 he writes

109
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,500
"neither from itself nor from another

110
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:46,916
nor from both nor without a cause does anything

111
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,166
anywhere ever arise"

112
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,250
this isn't just philosophy

113
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,291
it's an invitation to freedom

114
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,083
freedom from our fixed ideas

115
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,500
freedom from our rigid beliefs

116
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,458
freedom from our limited ways of seeing

117
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,208
then he revealed the two truths

118
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,500
in chapter 24 he declares

119
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,166
"without understanding the conventional truth

120
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,541
the ultimate cannot be taught

121
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,541
without understanding the ultimate truth

122
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,125
liberation cannot be achieved"

123
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:22,666
the first truth is the world we experience everyday

124
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,541
cars and buildings people and places

125
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,125
everything we can see and touch

126
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,791
but there's a deeper truth

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
the empty nature of all things

128
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,208
think of a rainbow

129
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,375
it appears real and you can see it clearly

130
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,333
you can point to it you can take its picture

131
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,333
but try to find where it really is

132
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,875
try to touch it try to capture it

133
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,125
it's both there and not there

134
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,208
finally

135
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,791
he showed us something profound about connection

136
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,125
in Chapter 24

137
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,333
he reveals "whatever is dependently co arisen

138
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,208
that is explained to be emptiness

139
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,291
that being a dependent designation

140
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:07,750
is itself the middle way" like waves in the ocean

141
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,791
everything rises together

142
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,875
no wave exists by itself

143
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,166
no wave has its own separate nature

144
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,916
no wave is truly independent

145
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:23,083
yet waves appear waves move waves crash on the shore

146
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,750
in chapter 25 he concludes

147
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,083
"between what ceases and what arises

148
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,500
there is not the slightest gap

149
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,583
nor between what ends and what begins

150
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,791
is there even the subtlest separation"

151
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,208
this is true for everything

152
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,583
including us we arise like waves

153
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,875
we move like rainbows

154
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,958
we exist like reflections in a mirror

155
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,708
this this was Nagarjuna's revolution

156
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:00,708
today great teachers continue this tradition

157
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,125
the Dalai Lama teaches it as a path of wisdom

158
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:07,333
Thich Nhat Hanh revealed its connection to mindfulness

159
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:11,666
and scholars like Jay Garfield help us understand it

160
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,958
in modern terms

161
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,041
different Buddhist tradition

162
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,583
each see something precious

163
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:18,375
here

164
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,291
Zen finds the empty nature of mind

165
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:26,083
Tibetan Buddhism explores deep analysis

166
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:31,166
while pure land traditions discover the nature of faith

167
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,166
itself

168
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,125
But what does all this mean for our lives today?

169
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,250
let's bring Nagarjuna's wisdom down to earth

170
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,875
think about your identity

171
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:49,125
who you are some days you feel unshakable

172
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,541
like a mountain

173
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,958
solid and permanent

174
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,416
other days you feel like nothing

175
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,625
like you're falling apart

176
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,416
like you might disappear

177
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,500
Nagarjuna shows us there's another way to see ourselves

178
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,333
like a river always flowing

179
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,500
always changing yet somehow still there

180
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,166
not totally solid

181
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,208
not totally empty

182
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,583
but flowing between both extremes

183
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,000
or think about your relationships

184
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,833
sometimes we cling too tight

185
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,250
trying to control everything

186
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,125
sometimes we push away afraid of getting hurt

187
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,291
but what if like waves in the ocean

188
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,083
were all connected not completely separate

189
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,125
not completely one but dancing in between

190
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,625
even modern science is catching up to this wisdom

191
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,791
quantum physics shows us

192
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,125
nothing is as solid as it seems

193
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,500
ecology reveals everything is interconnected

194
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,250
psychology teaches us  our minds are

195
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,625
constantly changing

196
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,541
let's look at three challenges we all face today

197
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,125
social media

198
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,666
where we create perfect versions of ourselves

199
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,250
or hide away completely

200
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,041
the middle way teaches us to be authentically present

201
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,166
without getting lost in appearances

202
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,791
career pressure

203
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,500
where we either burn out or give up on our dreams

204
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,125
the Middle Way shows us how to work with purpose

205
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:16,083
without being consumed by results and our biggest fear

206
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,833
change itself

207
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,708
we either resist it completely

208
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,916
or feel totally overwhelmed by it

209
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:28,000
but Nagarjuna's wisdom offers a different perspective

210
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,541
change isn't our enemy

211
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,000
it's the very nature of reality

212
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,083
when we understand this we find a new kind of freedom

213
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,500
this isn't just ancient philosophy

214
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:45,333
it's practical wisdom for modern life

215
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:53,250
so how do we begin to break free from extremes?

216
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,791
the key isn't trying to find perfect balance

217
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:59,500
it's learning to see through our fixed ideas completely

218
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,000
let's try something practical

219
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,250
think of a problem you're facing right now

220
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,958
something that feels solid

221
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,875
something that feels real

222
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,083
something that feels permanent

223
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:11,250
now

224
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,500
let's use Nagarjuna's tools to look at it differently

225
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,958
first question your assumptions

226
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,500
is this problem really as solid as it seems?

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,500
is it really permanent or is it changing?

228
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,708
then look for connections

229
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,166
how is this problem connected to other things

230
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,875
what conditions created it

231
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,750
what conditions might change it

232
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,041
finally notice the spaces between extremes

233
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,500
between "everything is hopeless"

234
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,500
and "everything must be perfect"

235
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,041
there are infinite possibilities

236
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,250
here's a meditation practice

237
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,583
to help you experience this directly

238
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,583
start by focusing on your breath

239
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,416
not controlling it

240
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,791
not leaving it alone

241
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,166
but finding that space in between

242
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,750
this is mindfulness

243
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,833
but with a deeper understanding

244
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,166
not just being present

245
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,958
but seeing the empty nature of presence itself

246
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,625
now watch your thoughts arise like waves in the ocean

247
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,833
not grabbing them

248
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,833
not pushing them away

249
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,041
but seeing their empty nature

250
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,750
this is what real freedom feels like

251
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,250
not the absence of problems

252
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,083
but seeing through them not escaping reality

253
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,541
but understanding it's true nature

254
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,250
freedom isn't a place we reach

255
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,708
it's a way of seeing

256
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,375
freedom isn't something we find

257
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,625
it's something we uncover

258
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,250
when we truly understand this

259
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,166
everything changes problems don't disappear

260
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,291
but they no longer bind us

261
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,208
challenges don't vanish but they no longer define us

262
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,750
this is the freedom Nagarjuna pointed to

263
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:02,041
the freedom that comes when we see through all extremes

264
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,541
so how do we live this wisdom in our everyday lives?

265
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,541
let's start with a simple practice

266
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,125
called "Both/And" thinking

267
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,666
when you catch yourself stuck between two extremes

268
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,458
pause and look for a third way

269
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,666
for example

270
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,708
you don't have to choose between loving others

271
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,500
completely and protecting yourself totally

272
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:33,333
you can be both caring and have healthy boundaries

273
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:39,000
another practice is watching how things change

274
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,208
notice how your emotions your thoughts

275
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,666
your experiences are always flowing

276
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,541
like clouds in the sky

277
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,875
they arise

278
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,833
they stay

279
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,125
they pass

280
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,791
in relationships

281
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,833
practice seeing connections

282
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,916
every person you meet is like you

283
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:05,916
flowing between extremes looking for solid ground

284
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,208
at work

285
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,875
let go of perfect and worthless

286
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,750
and instead focus on what's happening now

287
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,375
what's actually possible what's truly needed

288
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:19,750
remember

289
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,708
the middle way isn't a compromise

290
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,916
it's not about being lukewarm or playing it safe

291
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,416
it's about being fully alive in this moment

292
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,583
just as it is

293
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,916
many think emptiness means nothingness

294
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,458
or that the middle way means being passive

295
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,333
but Nagarjuna taught just the opposite

296
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,875
emptiness is fullness

297
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:46,458
and the middle way is the most dynamic way of being

298
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,000
this is the gift of the middle way

299
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,750
and not an escape from life

300
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,958
but a deeper way of living it

301
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,541
we began this journey and with a simple idea

302
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:05,291
the Buddhist discovery of a path between extremes

303
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:09,125
then Nagarjuna showed us something even more profound

304
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,208
the Middle Way isn't just a path

305
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,375
it's a completely new way of seeing

306
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,833
in our modern world where extremes pull us apart

307
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,166
this ancient wisdom offers something precious

308
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,708
a way to be fully present without getting lost

309
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,333
and the way to care deeply without burning out

310
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,291
a way to change completely without losing ourselves

311
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,083
the next time you feel stuck between two extremes

312
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,750
remember there's always another way

313
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,708
not a compromise but a revolution in seeing

314
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,375
this is the gift that's been passed down

315
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,583
through generations of seekers

316
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,958
and now it's in your hands

317
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,583
if you found value in these teachings

until then

325

may you find freedom beyond all extremes
