2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,679
last night I pulled over on a dark Road

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,360
the stars filled my windshield and that

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,080
question crashed into my mind what's the

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,680
real point of all this that question

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,840
haunts every human on earth buddhism's

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,080
answer the meaning of life isn't

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,640
something you find it's something you

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,160
stop searching

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,840
for that night this truth hit me so hard

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,160
I couldn't drive for an hour and when

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,360
you hear it you might need to sit down

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,200
too like a bubble like a dream

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,320
everything that exists is

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,360
transient these words from the diamond

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,640
Sutra changed my entire perspective on

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,120
life's meaning you know that feeling

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,879
when you finally see something that was

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,800
right in front of you all along Buddhism

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,079
showed me something about life's meaning

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,079
that was hiding in plain

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,399
sight hey guys Matt here from Buddha's

23
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,479
wisdom most of us chase purpose like

24
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,680
it's a prize we need to catch only to

25
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:10,119
end up exhausted and

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,320
empty Buddhism saw through this trap

27
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:14,600
thousands of years ago while the world

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,520
pushes you to discover your destiny

29
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,920
follow your dreams find

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,079
yourself Buddhism reveals something

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,200
radically

32
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:25,000
different this ancient wisdom doesn't

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,000
just change how you think about meaning

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,920
it transforms how you experience every

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,640
breath every moment every part of being

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,399
being alive the power of this Insight

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,479
shook me to my core and

38
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,479
now I'm going to show you

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,040
why think about this every time you

40
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,200
scroll through social media someone's

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,320
telling you to find your purpose or

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,079
discover your calling I used to think

43
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,000
that

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,960
too man I spent years jumping from one

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,719
passion to another meditation Retreats

46
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,200
career changes even living in a van for

47
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,759
a while the more I searched for meaning

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,520
the more stuck I felt crazy thing is

49
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,680
that's exactly what Buddha warned us

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,720
about here's what hit me like a truck

51
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,680
one day imagine you're watching a movie

52
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,879
but instead of enjoying it you keep

53
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,319
pausing every scene asking what's the

54
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,200
meaning of this movie what's its purpose

55
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,280
you totally miss the actual

56
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,560
movie that's what we're doing with our

57
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,239
lives we're so busy searching for

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,760
meaning that we're missing life at self

59
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,720
as the Buddha himself said do not go

60
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,640
after the past nor lose yourself in the

61
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:43,239
future for the past no longer exists and

62
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,280
the future is not yet here Buddhism

63
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,040
drops this mind-blowing truth

64
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,879
bomb the question what's the meaning of

65
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,280
life is like trying to grab air the

66
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,720
harder you squeeze the less you hold

67
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,159
it's not that life lacks meaning it's

68
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,440
that we're asking the wrong question

69
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,360
entirely Buddhist master ERS noticed

70
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,760
something

71
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,879
remarkable the people most obsessed with

72
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,200
finding their purpose were often the

73
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,319
most miserable why because they turned

74
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,920
life into a problem to solve instead of

75
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,799
an experience to

76
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,519
live last Tuesday I met James at my

77
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,040
local coffee shop Harvard grad

78
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,239
successful Tech startup founder picture

79
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,560
perfect family but there he was hands

80
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,959
shaking around his third espresso

81
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,560
telling me how empty he felt inside I

82
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,480
checked all the boxes he said but I

83
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,920
still wake up at 3:00 a.m. wondering

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,120
what it's all for sound familiar that's

85
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,840
the Trap Buddhism says we've got it

86
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,360
backwards we don't need to find meaning

87
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,000
we need to stop turning meaning into

88
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,239
this giant monster chasing us around

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,200
this reveals something crucial Buddhism

90
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,159
isn't saying just give up and accept

91
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,519
meaninglessness not even

92
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,560
close what the ancient Masters

93
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,120
discovered is way more

94
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,159
revolutionary they found that the

95
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,360
meaning of life is like your breath it's

96
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:06,519
already there but the moment you try to

97
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,560
control it you mess up its natural flow

98
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:09,560
and that's just the tip of the

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,440
iceberg the surprising thing about

100
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,440
buddhism's first Noble Truth it's not

101
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,519
some ancient Downer it's actually the

102
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,800
key to Freedom Buddha straight up said

103
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,639
life feels

104
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,720
unsatisfying not sometimes not when

105
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:32,039
things go wrong but as a basic fact m

106
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,639
mindblowing right most people hear this

107
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:37,080
and think buddhism's all doom and gloom

108
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,120
but stick with me this is where things

109
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,919
get good while Western philosophy often

110
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,840
sees life's meaning as something to

111
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,840
discover or create Buddhist wisdom

112
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,080
offers a radically different

113
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,320
perspective Eastern thought doesn't try

114
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,120
to solve the puzzle of meaning it

115
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,600
questions why we treat it as a puzzle at

116
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,759
all this isn't just a cultural

117
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,039
difference it's a fundamentally

118
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,800
different way of experiencing life

119
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,400
remember that coffee shop guy searching

120
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,000
for his purpose his problem wasn't that

121
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,639
he couldn't find meaning his problem was

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,960
thinking something was wrong because he

123
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,680
felt

124
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,840
unsatisfied see we've been sold this

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,120
story that once we find our purpose

126
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,360
everything clicks into place and we feel

127
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,880
complete but look around even people who

128
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,240
seem to have it all figured out still

129
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,479
feel that itch that sense that

130
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,000
something's missing so here's the

131
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,280
freedom formula Buddha dropped on us the

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,440
more we Chase

133
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,880
satisfaction the more it runs away it's

134
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:40,360
like trying to catch your Shadow you can

135
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,720
run forever but you'll never grab it The

136
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,759
Emptiness we feel it's not because we're

137
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,680
broken or missing something it's because

138
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:50,039
we're playing a game we can't win th not

139
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,520
Han puts it perfectly there is no way to

140
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,880
happiness happiness is the

141
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,319
way my own breakthrough came when I was

142
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,680
at this Tech startup crushing it doing

143
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,759
what I thought was my purpose dream job

144
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,680
job right but every achievement just led

145
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:09,160
to wanting more one night working late

146
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,520
it hit me the happiness I was chasing

147
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,960
wasn't at the end of any path the path

148
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,280
itself was the Trap this is where

149
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,479
Buddhism flips the script completely

150
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,960
instead of trying to fill the emptiness

151
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,280
what if and this is huge what if the

152
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,400
emptiness is actually the doorway to

153
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,120
Freedom think about it like this when

154
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,000
you stop trying to fill a cup that's

155
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,880
already full you suddenly notice it's

156
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,360
been overflowing the whole time but

157
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,280
Buddhism takes it even further the real

158
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,759
power move isn't just accepting that

159
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,639
life feels unsatisfying it's

160
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,000
understanding why this is actually

161
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,680
perfect when we stop fighting against

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,800
this basic truth something magical

163
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,080
happens the pressure

164
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,560
drops the chase

165
00:06:53,080 --> 00:07:00,120
ends and in that

166
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:02,599
space that's where real Freedom begins

167
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,160
and you know what's truly nuts the

168
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:07,800
moment you get this I mean really get it

169
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,879
your whole life

170
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,280
transforms not because you found some

171
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,960
Grand purpose but because you've stopped

172
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,360
letting that search run your

173
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,400
life it's like finally putting down a

174
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,759
heavy backpack you didn't even know you

175
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,919
were

176
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,879
carrying this leads us to something even

177
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,319
more mind-bending about what Buddhist

178
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,050
Masters discovered about living a

179
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:33,160
fulfilled life

180
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,479
[Music]

181
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,599
let me share something that happened to

182
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,720
my friend Sarah she spent 10 years

183
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,319
building a nonprofit that provided art

184
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,919
therapy for trauma

185
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,319
survivors her office walls were covered

186
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:49,280
with thank you letters her phone

187
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,400
constantly buzzed with messages from

188
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,720
grateful

189
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,000
families this was her calling until Co

190
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,039
hit within 3 months the funding

191
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,479
vanished but here's what shocked her

192
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,360
most

193
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,479
watching her identity crumble alongside

194
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,000
her

195
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:10,199
organization I realized I had become my

196
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,400
work she told me and when it

197
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:16,960
disappeared I didn't know who I was

198
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,159
anymore she didn't just lose her work

199
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,680
she lost her sense of purpose her

200
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:23,000
suffering wasn't from losing the

201
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,080
nonprofit it came from clinging to what

202
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,199
she thought gave her life

203
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,919
meaning here's what Buddhist Masters

204
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,479
figured out we suffer because we grip

205
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,760
too tightly to the story of who we

206
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:37,120
should be think about it like holding

207
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,360
sand squeeze too hard and it slips right

208
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,200
through your

209
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,839
fingers but keep your palm open and the

210
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,360
sand stays right there that's how

211
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,440
meaning works

212
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,080
too check this out there's this old zen

213
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,880
story about a monk who spent 20 years

214
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,440
searching for enlightenment one day he

215
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,399
was sweeping leaves totally focused on

216
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,560
just sweeping no big thoughts about

217
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,800
meaning or purpose

218
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,279
and

219
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,880
boom that's when it hit

220
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,800
him the meaning he chased for decades it

221
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,480
was in the simple Act of sweeping leaves

222
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,959
the search kept him from seeing what was

223
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,000
right in front of

224
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,800
him now this is where most people get

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,120
Buddhism wrong they think it's about

226
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,839
giving up or not caring but that's not

227
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,240
it at

228
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,640
all take my neighbor Mike professional

229
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,120
musician totally passionate about his

230
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,600
craft but he was so obset with making it

231
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,160
that he stopped enjoying music itself

232
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,160
one day he decided to let go of the

233
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,000
pressure to succeed and guess what his

234
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,160
music got better he started booking more

235
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,560
gigs by releasing his death grip on

236
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:50,320
meaning he actually found

237
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,720
it the real twist Buddhist Masters teach

238
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,880
that fulfillment isn't something you

239
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,560
achieve it's what's left when you stop

240
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,720
trying to achieve it it's like you know

241
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,880
when you're having an amazing

242
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,680
conversation with friends

243
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,560
and you completely forget to check your

244
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,600
phone that's it that's the sweet spot

245
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,200
you're not trying to make the moment

246
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,079
meaningful you're just fully in it I

247
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,680
tested this myself for one week I

248
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,760
stopped asking if what I was doing was

249
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,680
meaningful enough started just showing

250
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,640
up fully for whatever was happening

251
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,360
doing dishes talking to strangers

252
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,600
writing scripts for you

253
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,560
guys something

254
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,040
shifted life didn't become more

255
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,560
meaningful

256
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,880
I just stopped missing the meaning that

257
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,720
was already

258
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,200
there Buddhist Masters have this saying

259
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,160
before Enlightenment chop wood carry

260
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,480
water after Enlightenment chop wood

261
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,959
carry water the actions don't change

262
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,240
what changes is how we experience them

263
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:52,880
the meaning isn't in what you do it's in

264
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,120
how completely you show up for it this

265
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,120
brings us to the really practical stuff

266
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,010
actual tools you can use to experience

267
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,139
this shift yourself

268
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,139
[Music]

269
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,279
let me tell you about this experiment I

270
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:11,079
did last month three simple Buddhist

271
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:13,440
practices 30 days no expectations just

272
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:16,120
pure curiosity what happened next

273
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,440
totally changed how I experienced life

274
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,079
but before I share these practices you

275
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,480
need to know these aren't your typical

276
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:25,000
live your best life tips these are

277
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,079
ancient tools that cut straight to the

278
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,320
core of experiencing

279
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:33,839
meaning first practice the morning death

280
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,720
meditation sounds dark right but stay

281
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,320
with me every morning I spent 2 minutes

282
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,680
remembering that this day might be my

283
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:45,600
last not in a depressing way in a wake

284
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,440
up and smell the coffee way when you

285
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,519
really get that nothing lasts

286
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,880
forever something

287
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,880
clicks that argument with your mom not

288
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,240
so important that

289
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,800
Sunset Suddenly

290
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,600
Beautiful my friend Tom tried this after

291
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,800
his

292
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,360
burnout now he says he finally knows

293
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,160
what it means to be

294
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,079
alive second practice what Buddhists

295
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,519
call The Observer throughout the day

296
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:15,000
catch yourself wanting things to be

297
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:17,480
different wanting a better job wanting

298
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,199
more followers wanting life to have more

299
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,760
meaning just notice the

300
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:25,839
wanting don't judge it don't try to stop

301
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:29,920
it watch it like you're watching clouds

302
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:33,480
pass Lisa one of our viewers tried this

303
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,600
for a week she realized she spent hours

304
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,240
each day mentally rewriting her life

305
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,600
instead of living

306
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,720
it third practice full

307
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:47,680
engagement pick one everyday activity

308
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,760
brushing teeth walking to the bus

309
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,560
whatever do it like it's the most

310
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,079
important thing in the universe feel

311
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,360
every

312
00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:00,000
sensation when your mind wanders to more

313
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:03,279
important things bring it back sounds

314
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,720
simple that's the trick the meaning we

315
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,839
chase out there it's hiding in these

316
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,680
tiny moments these practices transform

317
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,000
not just your inner world but how you

318
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,639
show up in your community and

319
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,199
work tnan once said the miracle is not

320
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,880
to walk on water the miracle is to walk

321
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:25,560
on earth this simple truth reveals

322
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,639
itself when we fully engage with each

323
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,320
moment here's what's fascinating about

324
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,000
impermanence it's not just that that

325
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,519
things change it's that change itself is

326
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,199
what makes life Rich think about your

327
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:40,240
favorite song if every note lasted

328
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:42,199
forever it wouldn't be music it's

329
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,600
beautiful because it flows because each

330
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:46,760
note appears and

331
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,320
disappears that's not just poetry that's

332
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,759
how meaning

333
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,040
works let me share what happened with my

334
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:56,480
brother he lost his Tech job thought his

335
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,519
life was over started these practices

336
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,120
out of

337
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:04,240
desperation 6 months months later he's

338
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,959
teaching coding to kids says he finally

339
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,519
gets it meaning isn't in the job title

340
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,000
it's in the moments when he sees a kid's

341
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,160
eyes light up he stopped chasing the

342
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,600
perfect career and started showing up

343
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,079
for what's right in front of

344
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,759
him the transformation happens when you

345
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,199
flip the script instead of asking what's

346
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:26,639
the meaning of this moment ask how fully

347
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:29,120
can I live it that's not just a mental

348
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,399
shift it's a complete reboot of how you

349
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,440
experience being alive but here's the

350
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:34,440
real kicker about these

351
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,880
practices let me drop something heavy on

352
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,279
you something that took me years to

353
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,680
really get Buddhism says you're already

354
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,279
complete not you'll be complete when not

355
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,639
you're complete if you're complete right

356
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,800
now reading these words sounds crazy

357
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,720
right but this Insight shatters

358
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,560
everything we've been taught about

359
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,600
self-improvement think about a wave in

360
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,680
the ocean does it ever stop and ask am I

361
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,880
enough no because it's not separate from

362
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:13,120
the ocean and neither are you you're not

363
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,120
broken you're not lost you're already

364
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,040
home the Buddhist words ring true here

365
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,440
you yourself as much as anybody in the

366
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,440
entire universe deserve your love and

367
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,279
affection here's the power move that

368
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,040
changed everything instead of chasing

369
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,839
the next moment drop into this one not

370
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,720
because this moment is special but

371
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:36,880
because it's the only moment that's real

372
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,720
your breath right now the weight of your

373
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,160
body The Sounds around you that's not

374
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,360
just meditation

375
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:49,560
talk that's where life actually

376
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,480
happens want to try something Wild next

377
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,000
time you're stuck in traffic instead of

378
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:57,040
wishing you were somewhere else zoom in

379
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,360
on the present moment feel the steering

380
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,959
wheel notice the colors of the cars

381
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,399
listen to The Sounds you might discover

382
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,800
that the meaning you're seeking isn't

383
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,920
hiding in some future achievement it's

384
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,319
right here in the middle of what you

385
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,160
think is boring it's been with you this

386
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:15,519
whole

387
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,120
time the only question is are you

388
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,120
willing to see

389
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:23,319
it my friend Kate started doing this

390
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:26,680
simple practice she sets three random

391
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:29,160
alarms during the day when they go off

392
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:32,880
she stops and notices five things about

393
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,000
the present moment after 2 weeks she

394
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,160
told me life feels like it's an

395
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,720
HD not because anything changed but

396
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,880
because she stopped waiting for life to

397
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,399
start the meaning trap has a back door

398
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,319
and that back door is realizing there's

399
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,800
no trap at all you're not stuck you're

400
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:53,120
not lost you're not

401
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,399
incomplete the search for meaning is

402
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,959
like looking for your glasses while

403
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,480
wearing them the moment you see this

404
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,800
really see it

405
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,560
everything

406
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,799
shifts buddhism's big revolutionary move

407
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,439
isn't giving you something new to

408
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,000
believe in it's showing you how to drop

409
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,240
the beliefs that make you feel separate

410
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
from life when you stop trying to get

411
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,720
somewhere you might notice you're

412
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,079
already home and this brings us to the

413
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,079
final

414
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,439
piece now you might be thinking this

415
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,480
sounds great but my mind races

416
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,039
constantly or I barely have time to

417
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,440
breathe let alone meditate

418
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:33,720
here's the beauty of the Buddhist

419
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,520
approach it works especially well when

420
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,080
life gets messy each distraction becomes

421
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,120
an invitation to

422
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,120
practice every busy moment offers a

423
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,720
chance to wake up the key isn't to clear

424
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,360
your schedule it's to bring clear

425
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,360
awareness to whatever is already

426
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,520
happening remember that night I told you

427
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,240
about sitting in my car under the stars

428
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,720
wrestling with life's meaning I never

429
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,039
imagined the the answer would be so

430
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,039
simple and so

431
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,440
revolutionary here's what Buddhism

432
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,039
taught me life's meaning isn't some

433
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,400
hidden treasure waiting to be discovered

434
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:17,159
it's happening right now in this breath

435
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,200
in these words between us look you don't

436
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:22,159
need to move to a monastery or become a

437
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,120
full-time meditator you can have goals

438
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:26,600
dreams and

439
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,039
Ambitions the secret is Shifting how you

440
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,400
hold them like a bird Pur on a branch

441
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:35,360
not too tight not too

442
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:39,120
loose your purpose might be teaching

443
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,320
healing creating or raising an amazing

444
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,840
family do it fully but don't let it

445
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,640
become a

446
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,000
cage take these three things with you

447
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,880
first meaning comes alive in the moments

448
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,200

449
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:58,080
already complete everything else is

450
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,240
extra credit third the ordinary stuff

451
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,159

452
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,360
