1
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:08,700
what if I told you

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,500
the greatest yogi in Tibet was trained by a man who

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,300
some accounts say made him build and destroy a tower

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,333
not once not twice

5
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:18,500
but as many as 12 times

6
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:20,866
here's what you're about to witness

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,700
bleeding hands broken dreams

8
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,266
and a teacher who smiles while watching you demolish

9
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:28,266
months of work with your bare hands

10
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:30,866
start over he says

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,766
this time make it perfect

12
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,100
this isn't your peaceful meditation retreat

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,100
this is Marpa the translator

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,266
the farmer mystic

15
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:41,466
who brought esoteric teachings from India

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,200
and turned spiritual training

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,600
into the ultimate test of human endurance

18
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:47,800
today we meet the teacher

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,266
who believed the only way to save a killer's soul

20
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:52,533
was to break everything else first

21
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:55,466
can you shatter someone so completely

22
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:57,300
that enlightenment grows from the pieces

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,200
welcome back to Buddha's wisdom

24
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:03,966
I'm Matt and we're continuing

25
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:06,600
the wildest redemption story in Buddhist history

26
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,466
and here's the crazy part

27
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:10,600
so many of you have been asking

28
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,733
can someone who's done terrible things actually change

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,133
well you're about to get your answer

30
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,366
last episode ended with Milarepa

31
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:20,666
standing in the ruins of his magical revenge

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,800
35 wedding guests dead his sister asking

33
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:28,766
what have you become he discovered the answer

34
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,600
a monster

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,100
who needed to die before anything good could be born

36
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:34,666
remember our Monkey King series

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,900
Sun Wukong's ego was massive

38
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:39,333
but at least he didn't murder entire families

39
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,100
Milarepa's transformation

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,833
required something way more extreme

41
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,400
than breathing exercises and positive thinking

42
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,566
he needed a teacher willing to destroy him

43
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,300
and get this he found one

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,800
over the next 25 minutes

45
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,533
you'll witness spiritual training

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,066
that makes any modern military training look gentle

47
00:01:58,066 --> 00:02:01,366
by comparison we're talking years of manual labor

48
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:02,600
that wrecks your body

49
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,700
cave meditation that literally turns you green

50
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,500
and a final demon battle that could kill you

51
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,566
but here's what makes this absolutely insane

52
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:13,866
it actually works by the end

53
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:15,966
you'll see whether someone who's committed mass murder

54
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:18,166
can actually claw their way back to the light

55
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,666
the method more suffering than you can imagine

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,166
after the massacre

57
00:02:28,633 --> 00:02:31,166
Milarepa wandered Tibet's mountains for months

58
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,366
carrying guilt that felt heavier than stone

59
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,433
searching for someone who could teach him

60
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:37,000
to undo what he'd done

61
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,100
local monks took one look at this pale

62
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,200
haunted figure and slammed their monastery doors

63
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,133
nobody wanted the wedding killer as a student

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,466
then he heard stories about Marpa

65
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:51,366
the translator

66
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:54,200
and this guy's backstory is absolutely wild

67
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:57,333
accounts describe him as stocky and bearded

68
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:59,466
with a booming laugh and farmer's hands

69
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,366
more villager than mystic

70
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,100
but those deep set

71
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,966
intense eyes seem to see straight through your soul

72
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:07,966
now imagine this farmer

73
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,966
hearing about incredible Buddhist teachings

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,333
available in India

75
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:14,200
but getting there means crossing mountain passes

76
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,733
that locals call death's gateway

77
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,766
walking through territories

78
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,366
controlled by hostile armies

79
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,366
and somehow

80
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:23,966
surviving months of travel that would kill most people

81
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:26,666
most sane individuals would say

82
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,166
forget it Marpa said

83
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,400
I'm going anyway

84
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:31,066
three times

85
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,866
three separate expeditions to India

86
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,500
each time collecting more advanced tantric practices

87
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,400
than most Tibetans would ever see

88
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:40,100
secret teachings from masters

89
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,533
who only shared them with their closest disciples

90
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:44,866
then he'd return to his valley

91
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:46,266
and go back to farming barley

92
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:47,666
like he'd been on vacation

93
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:50,533
when Milarepa finally found him

94
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,333
Marpa was plowing a field in the Lodrak Valley

95
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,700
cursing at stubborn oxen covered in mud

96
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:58,933
looking like any frustrated farmer

97
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:01,466
this was the man who would transform a killer

98
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:04,200
into someone later known as Jetsun Milarepa

99
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,600
Venerable Master Milarepa

100
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:08,733
one of Tibet's greatest yogis

101
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,633
are you the great teacher Marpa

102
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:14,100
Milarepa asked nervously

103
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:15,733
Marpa stopped

104
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,300
looked at this desperate young man with haunted eyes

105
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,133
and burst out laughing teacher

106
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:23,800
I'm trying to plant barley before winter kills

107
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,066
everything you want

108
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:28,500
the master he's probably drinking tea up at the house

109
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,100
I'm nobody special

110
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:33,600
can you imagine the confusion

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,100
you're expecting some mystical guru on a throne

112
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:37,766
and instead you get a farmer

113
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:39,266
who pretends he's never heard of himself

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,200
for hours Marpa played this game

115
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:43,766
fed Milarepa dinner

116
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,066
listened to his confession about mass murder

117
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:47,266
and black magic

118
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,500
all while acting like he had no idea where this famous

119
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,933
teacher might be hiding

120
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,400
and here's the thing this wasn't cruelty

121
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,100
this was testing

122
00:04:57,633 --> 00:05:00,333
real masters don't accept students immediately

123
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,566
they check for desperation humility

124
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,500
willingness to be treated like dirt

125
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,700
if that's what transformation requires

126
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,566
when Marpa finally revealed his identity

127
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:13,500
Milarepa collapsed and begged to become a student

128
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:16,700
I've killed 35 innocent people with sorcery

129
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,600
he confessed

130
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,533
I need Dharma teachings to purify this karma

131
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:22,666
I'll do anything you ask

132
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:25,500
Marpa studied this broken young man

133
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:27,200
then quoted something his own teacher

134
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,366
Naropa had told him in the caves of India

135
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,666
the dharma is not bought with gold

136
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,400
but with the marrow of your bones

137
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:34,300
then

138
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,966
he smiled in a way that should have terrified Milarepa

139
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,266
perfect I specialize in hopeless cases

140
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:41,866
but understand this

141
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,233
my methods will make your sorcery training

142
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:45,900
look like a pleasant afternoon

143
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,500
Milarepa nodded eagerly

144
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,266
he had no idea he'd signed up for years of torture

145
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:54,266
because Marpa wasn't planning to teach him Buddhism

146
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:55,766
he was planning to kill everything

147
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:57,600
Milarepa thought he was

148
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,300
build me a tower Marpa said

149
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,100
the next morning

150
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,766
handing milarepa a pile of stones nine stories tall

151
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:10,933
perfect stonework no help from anyone

152
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,766
Milarepa thought this was symbolic

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,366
some kind of patience lesson

154
00:06:15,366 --> 00:06:16,866
before getting real teachings

155
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,900
he was dead wrong Marpa literally wanted a tower

156
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,766
for months milarepa hauled stones up that hill

157
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,133
each rock had to be shaped by hand

158
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,166
every level precisely aligned

159
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:31,166
his hands split and bled from the rough granite

160
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
his back screamed constantly

161
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,133
ever had a boss who made impossible demands

162
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,166
Marpa made them look merciful

163
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,100
the other students watched with growing concern

164
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:44,200
a young monk named Tsultrim whispered to his friend

165
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,000
this isn't spiritual training

166
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:48,700
this is punishment for a crime we don't understand

167
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,900
slowly painfully

168
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:55,800
a magnificent nine story tower rose from the Hillside

169
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:57,766
architectural masterpiece

170
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
something that would stand for generations

171
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,966
when Milarepa placed the final stone

172
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:07,000
exhausted but genuinely proud he ran to get Marpa

173
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,466
master come see what I've built

174
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:13,766
Marpa climbed the hill like a building inspector

175
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,033
examined every level

176
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:17,166
with infuriating attention to detail

177
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,733
walked around the structure three times

178
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,333
then nodded thoughtfully

179
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,933
interesting work he said

180
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,700
now tear it down

181
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:29,666
Milarapa stared I'm sorry what

182
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,466
tear it down every stone

183
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,466
the foundation was wrong from the beginning

184
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,933
start over

185
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,866
pause and think about this for a second

186
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:38,566
you've poured

187
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:40,566
months of your life into something beautiful

188
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,466
and your teacher casually tells you to demolish it

189
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:46,400
because of some technical flaw you never understood

190
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,566
most people would quit storm off

191
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,333
demand an explanation

192
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:53,366
but Milarepa

193
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:55,900
remembered the 35 wedding guests he'd murdered

194
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,233
maybe he deserved

195
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:59,500
exactly this kind of meaningless torment

196
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:03,600
the sound of stones crashing down the Hillside

197
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,633
echoed through the valley

198
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:08,066
like thunder other students winced with each impact

199
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,633
tower No. 2 took even longer

200
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:13,400
better materials flawless construction

201
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,700
good work Marpa said after his inspection

202
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,700
now tear it down these stones are the wrong colour

203
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,066
and here's where it gets insane

204
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:23,966
traditional accounts vary

205
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:26,766
but some sources say this happened not once

206
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:31,000
not twice but tower after tower after tower

207
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,300
each one more perfect than the last

208
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,566
each demolition more devastating

209
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,033
after demolishing

210
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:39,866
what might have been his seventh attempt

211
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,366
Milarepa finally broke down sobbing

212
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,100
that's when Marpa did something unexpected

213
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:47,166
he sat down next to his student

214
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,533
and for a moment his farmer's mask slipped away

215
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,666
you think I'm being cruel

216
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,333
he said quietly but look at your hands

217
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,733
Milarepa looked the scars told a story

218
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,133
months of suffering years of dedication

219
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,466
those hands once summoned death with magic

220
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:08,966
Marpa continued now they create beauty from stone

221
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,133
that's karma in action

222
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,000
the same hands that caused suffering

223
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,100
now carving the path to awakening

224
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,600
for the first time

225
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Milarepa began to understand this wasn't punishment

226
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,600
this was surgery removing the spiritual disease

227
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,000
that had created a killer

228
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,066
every tower represented everything

229
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:30,733
Milarepa thought he deserved

230
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:33,866
every demolition taught him that he deserved nothing

231
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,900
the person who had Learned sorcery for revenge

232
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,966
who had demanded justice through violence

233
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:42,533
that person was dying one demolished tower at a time

234
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:49,033
after years of tower building

235
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:50,700
had shattered every expectation

236
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:52,800
Marpa finally spoke

237
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,700
the words Milarepa had been desperately waiting for

238
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,666
you're ready for meditation instruction

239
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,833
he handed milarepa a worn scroll

240
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,400
covered in Sanskrit text

241
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:05,866
advanced practices for working with subtle energy

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,400
techniques for recognizing the nature of consciousness

243
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,333
itself methods that normally required constant guidance

244
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:14,166
go to that cave

245
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,866
don't come out until you've mastered everything

246
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:16,733
written here

247
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,900
the cave was barely large enough for one person

248
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,600
cold as winter night dark as the bottom of a well

249
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:27,400
so isolated that even bird songs couldn't reach inside

250
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:30,700
how long should I stay milarepa asked

251
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:32,933
until you're done Marpa replied

252
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,433
three years three years

253
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,900
in what felt more like a tomb than a meditation hall

254
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:40,066
the food Marpa provided

255
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:43,166
just enough barley flour to avoid starvation

256
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,933
when even that ran out milarepa faced a choice

257
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,933
leave the cave and admit failure

258
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,900
or find another way to survive

259
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,166
the mountains were covered in stinging nettles

260
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:57,800
touching them felt like being burned alive

261
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:59,466
eating them was torture

262
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,566
the bitter taste would make you vomit

263
00:11:01,766 --> 00:11:03,600
but they would keep you alive

264
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,000
for months then years

265
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,500
Milarepa survived on nothing except these cursed weeds

266
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:12,300
and here's where it gets absolutely wild

267
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,200
the transformation was horrifying

268
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:17,233
his body wasted away

269
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:20,166
until every bone showed through paper thin skin

270
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:24,666
the chlorophyll turned him green skin hair

271
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,966
even his nails

272
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:28,833
when villagers occasionally glimpsed this skeletal

273
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,466
green figure moving through the forest like a ghost

274
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:34,000
children ran screaming to their mothers

275
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,400
adults whispered Protection mantras

276
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,500
and made signs against evil spirits

277
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,266
they thought they were seeing a hungry ghost

278
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:44,300
a spirit of someone who had died with terrible karma

279
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,666
and couldn't find peace in a way

280
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,166
they were absolutely right

281
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,066
but something incredible was happening inside that cave

282
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,133
his meditation deepened as his body disappeared

283
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,400
with nowhere to go nothing to distract him

284
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,566
no comfort to cling to his consciousness had no choice

285
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:04,733
except to expand beyond normal human limitations

286
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,100
the guilt over 35 murders was dissolving

287
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,733
like salt in water

288
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,466
not because he'd forgotten what he'd done

289
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,000
but because the he who had committed those crimes

290
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,366
was starving to death in that cave

291
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:22,633
during the deepest meditation states

292
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:25,366
when the boundary between his mind and infinite space

293
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:27,000
began dissolving completely

294
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,966
Milarepa experienced something that would later

295
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:31,966
become one of his most famous songs

296
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:35,566
I have no food I have no clothes

297
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,600
but I am rich in the dharma

298
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,833
the person who had demanded material justice

299
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,333
was learning to find wealth in emptiness itself

300
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,466
when he finally emerged after three years

301
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,133
skeletal and green as a mountain spirit

302
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,100
even his own reflection in streams

303
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,733
looked alien and frightening

304
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,666
the killer was almost dead

305
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,766
what would replace him remained to be seen

306
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:00,066
but the final test was coming

307
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,166
one person couldn't stand

308
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,933
watching this gradual destruction

309
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:10,700
Dagmema Marpa's wife

310
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:13,466
had witnessed the scarred hands from Tower Building

311
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,200
the growing desperation

312
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,833
now she occasionally glimpsed this green

313
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,300
skeletal figure during his rare appearances

314
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,300
and her heart shattered

315
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,933
this has gone too far

316
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,666
she told Marpa one evening as they sat by their fire

317
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,966
that boy is dying up there

318
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:32,633
good Marpa replied

319
00:13:32,633 --> 00:13:34,100
without looking up from his tea

320
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,700
the boy who killed 35 people needs to die

321
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,166
some versions of the story say

322
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,100
Dagmema secretly helped Milarepa

323
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,566
during these cave years others claim

324
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:46,766
she simply begged her husband to show mercy

325
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,900
what's certain is this her compassion

326
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,900
created a crisis that threatened everything

327
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,433
when Marpa traveled to teach other students

328
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,566
in distant valleys

329
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,800
Dagmema made a decision that would change everything

330
00:13:59,466 --> 00:14:01,266
she climbed to the cave with food

331
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:03,733
warm clothes and most dangerously

332
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,300
human kindness

333
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:07,800
what she found horrified her

334
00:14:07,966 --> 00:14:09,400
this skeletal figure

335
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:12,166
so weak he could barely lift his head

336
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,066
still sitting in meditation posture

337
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:16,933
with fierce determination burning in his sunken eyes

338
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,700
my husband is testing your resolve

339
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,400
she whispered but I can see you've endured enough

340
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,100
surely the dharma allows for mercy

341
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,500
for the first time in years

342
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,566
Milarepa felt someone cared whether he lived or died

343
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:36,266
when Marpa returned from his teaching tour weeks later

344
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:38,333
he immediately sensed the change

345
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,000
his student's desperate edge had been softened

346
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,866
by comfort

347
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
who helped you he demanded

348
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,333
Milarepa confessed about Dagmema's visits

349
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,866
what followed wasn't an explosion of shouting

350
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:51,733
something far more terrifying

351
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,166
Marpa went completely silent

352
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:55,866
when he finally spoke

353
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:58,333
his voice was cold as mountain winter

354
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:00,066
my own wife

355
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,400
undermining everything I've worked to achieve

356
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:05,566
his farmer's warmth had vanished completely

357
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:08,500
do you understand what kindness does to someone

358
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,066
trying to transcend ego

359
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:13,500
Dagmema tried to defend her actions

360
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,400
he's endured enough surely the dharma allows for mercy

361
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,566
mercy

362
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,266
Marpa's quiet fury was more frightening than any scream

363
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,133
a mass murderer receives exactly what karma provides

364
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:28,800
nothing more

365
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,900
nothing less

366
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,300
the argument that followed

367
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,900
threatened to destroy their marriage

368
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,500
Milarepa realized he'd caused this crisis

369
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,166
through his weakness his need for comfort

370
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,366
his inability to face the full weight of what he'd done

371
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:45,866
there's only one way to resolve this

372
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:47,600
Marpa declared with finality

373
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,766
final test tonight

374
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,466
either you achieve complete realization

375
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:55,133
or you die with your karma unresolved

376
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,833
the look in his deep

377
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,866
set eyes suggested death was the more likely outcome

378
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:03,100
everything had been leading to this moment

379
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:10,566
sit there Marpa commanded

380
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,666
pointing to an isolated meditation area

381
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,066
far from the house far from any help

382
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,600
face everything you've done

383
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,733
every person you've killed

384
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,933
every family you've destroyed

385
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,400
achieve enlightenment tonight or die trying

386
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:30,866
milarepa skeletal and green from years of nettle eating

387
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:34,366
nodded and sat in meditation posture one final time

388
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,933
in Buddhist thought karma is inescapable

389
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:40,000
but it can be transformed

390
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,033
tonight would determine whether

391
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:44,100
Milarepa could turn the poison of his past

392
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,766
into the medicine of awakening

393
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:47,866
he closed his eyes

394
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:50,333
went deeper into awareness than ever before

395
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,400
and entered the space where all his guilt lived

396
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:56,766
at first the profound stillness

397
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,133
he'd Learned during three years of cave meditation

398
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,466
then something shifted in the darkness

399
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:04,666
the air grew thick as storm clouds

400
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,800
shadows began moving without any light to cast them

401
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,533
the temperature dropped

402
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,766
until his breath became visible mist

403
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,700
a presence materialized

404
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,300
that made every survival instinct scream in terror

405
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:18,900
massive eyes like molten metal

406
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,600
fangs that dripped with accumulated darkness

407
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,066
traditional accounts describe Milarepa

408
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:26,566
facing terrifying demons during his retreats

409
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:30,100
but imagine for someone who'd committed mass murder

410
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:33,133
those demons might have worn the faces of his victims

411
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:35,600
so it said in a voice

412
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,733
like grinding bones and screaming wind

413
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,533
the killer thinks meditation erases murder

414
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:42,433
behind the demon

415
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:44,566
figures began appearing in the darkness

416
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,200
wedding guests children

417
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,800
innocent relatives people

418
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,700
whose lives he'd stolen with supernatural vengeance

419
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:55,966
you think sitting in caves makes you pure

420
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,300
the demon continued

421
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,400
you think suffering pays for what you've done to us

422
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,466
terror

423
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:04,000
beyond anything he'd experienced with black magic

424
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,266
this wasn't some meditation vision

425
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
this felt real as stone

426
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:10,800
solid as death itself

427
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:13,666
the accumulated weight of his karma

428
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,766
manifesting

429
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:16,966
as something that could destroy him completely

430
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,366
for a moment he almost fled

431
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,066
screaming into the night then

432
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,233
he remembered something the Buddha had once said

433
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:24,700
when facing his own demons

434
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,100
I see you Mara

435
00:18:27,866 --> 00:18:29,566
I know who you are

436
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,266
Milarepa opened his eyes

437
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:34,066
looked directly at this manifestation

438
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:35,666
of everything he'd done wrong

439
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,466
and made a choice

440
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:38,433
that would determine whether redemption was real

441
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:39,766
or beautiful lie

442
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,900
he stood up his skeletal frame shook with exhaustion

443
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,400
his green skin showed every bone

444
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:48,200
yet when he spoke

445
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,533
his voice carried strength that surprised even him

446
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,733
you're absolutely right

447
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,333
he said to the demon and the faces of the dead

448
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,533
I am a killer I did murder innocent people

449
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:04,800
the demon smiled sensing victory was within reach

450
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,100
Milarepa took a step forward toward the nightmare

451
00:19:08,366 --> 00:19:09,533
but watch

452
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,733
the demon lunged forward claws extended like knives

453
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,900
ready to tear apart this skeletal figure

454
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
who dared face the weight of mass murder

455
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:23,000
the faces of the dead began screaming for justice

456
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,866
for revenge for the very blood payment

457
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:28,100
that Milarepa had once demanded for himself

458
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:32,333
and milarepa broken and green from years of suffering

459
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,766
stood at the moment that determines every human life

460
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,066
can someone who has committed terrible acts

461
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:42,200
truly transform

462
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:44,966
or are we forever prisoners of our worst decisions

463
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
one day

464
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,366
this broken figure would be called Jetsun Milarepa

465
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,200
and his voice would shake mountains

466
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,433
with songs of enlightenment

467
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:55,100
that are still sung in Tibetan valleys today

468
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:59,333
but right now it trembled before the demons of his past

469
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,533
what happens next determines everything

470
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,166
in Part 3 we'll witness the most intense

471
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,900
spiritual battle ever recorded

472
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,433
the final test of whether light can truly emerge

473
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:11,733
from the deepest darkness

474
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,500
how many of you have done something you deeply regret

475
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,400
something that made you question

476
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,066
whether you could ever be forgiven

477
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,466
because what Milarepa does in this moment

478
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:23,566
will challenge everything

479
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:25,466
you think you know about redemption

480
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,066
if you're following this impossible journey

481
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:31,366

that will redefine how you think about redemption

the ending of Milarepa's journey

486
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,966
is unlike anything you expect

487
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,566
and it still sung in Tibet a thousand years later

488
