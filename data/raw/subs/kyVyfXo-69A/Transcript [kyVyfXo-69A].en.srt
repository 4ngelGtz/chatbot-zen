1
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,625
you're meditating peacefully under a tree

2
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,291
when you hear thundering footsteps

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,541
you open your eyes and there's a massive

4
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:15,791
drunk elephant charging straight at you

5
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,375
but here's the insane part

6
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,625
the person who sent this killer elephant

7
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:23,750
isn't some random enemy it's your own cousin

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,833
your childhood best friend

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,750
have you ever had family turn against you

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,125
ever wondered how far jealousy could push someone

11
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,291
well buckle up

12
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,708
and this this is just attempt number one

13
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,833
Meet Devadatta Buddhism's version of Judas

14
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,166
the disciple who turns against his master

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,791
but with three murder attempts and a body count plan

16
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,875
three assassination attempts

17
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,166
one family betrayal and a story

18
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,166
that'll change how you think about toxic relatives

19
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:54,958
forever

20
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,291
this story isn't just legend

21
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,000
it's recorded across multiple ancient texts

22
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:03,083
including the Vinaya Pitaka and the Cullavagga

23
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:06,875
and what it reveals about human jealousy is wild

24
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,833
but what Buddha did next will blow your mind

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,458
so who exactly was Devadatta

26
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,916
and how did Buddha's own cousin

27
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,375
become his deadliest enemy

28
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,666
two boys growing up in the same royal palace

29
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,708
both princes both incredibly talented

30
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,791
but only one gets called the Chosen One

31
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:33,458
Siddhartha you know him as Buddha was the golden child

32
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,875
prophecies royal treatment

33
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,916
everyone talking about his destiny

34
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,375
Devadatta?

35
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,958
he was just the other prince

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,208
the backup the spare

37
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:45,916
but get this

38
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,458
Devadatta wasn't just good at everything

39
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:49,958
he was exceptional

40
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,333
he could shoot arrows with deadly precision

41
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:53,875
wrestle wild animals

42
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,666
and had this magnetic personality that drew people to

43
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,500
him

44
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,500
ever feel like you're living in someone else's shadow

45
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,250
that's Devadatta's entire childhood

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,750
every single day

47
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,250
people talking about how special his cousin is

48
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,333
while he's just there now

49
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,500
imagine this happening in your own family

50
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,458
your sibling gets all the attention

51
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,833
all the praise all the opportunities

52
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,416
how would that feel

53
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,791
how far might that jealousy push you

54
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,708
fast forward Siddhartha becomes Buddha

55
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,250
attracts thousands of followers

56
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,333
kings bow down to him your childhood playmate is now

57
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,541
literally the most famous person alive

58
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,458
that kind of jealousy

59
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:39,250
it's one of the three poisons Buddha warned about greed

60
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,750
hatred and delusion

61
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,833
and Devadatta was about to drink all three

62
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,416
some say Devadatta even admired Siddhartha once

63
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,041
before the jealousy began

64
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,750
but jealousy was about to turn deadly

65
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,958
Devadatta is watching his cousin

66
00:02:58,958 --> 00:02:59,916
become the world's biggest

67
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,208
spiritual celebrity

68
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,208
and the jealousy is eating him alive

69
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,916
but he doesn't just want to compete with Buddha

70
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,000
he wants him gone permanently

71
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,833
his first murder plot absolutely insane

72
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,166
ancient India no guns

73
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:19,291
no poison so what do you use to kill someone

74
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,000
a massive drunk elephant

75
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,500
Meet Nalagiri a war elephant

76
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,375
already aggressive already dangerous

77
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,750
but Devadatta takes it to the next level

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,833
he gets this beast

79
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,291
completely wasted on fermented rice wine

80
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,416
until it's stumbling around

81
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,875
completely out of control

82
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,416
then he waits

83
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,708
Buddha's walking through the narrow streets of Rajagaha

84
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,208
collecting alms completely peaceful

85
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,791
completely unprotected and Devadatta knows his routine

86
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,666
so one morning just as Buddha's walking down

87
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,541
this narrow street with his disciples

88
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,750
Devadatta releases Nalagiri

89
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,000
imagine this thundering noise

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,083
ground shaking people screaming

91
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,166
this massive

92
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,750
drunken elephant comes charging around the corner

93
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,958
trunk swinging tusks gleaming

94
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,291
eyes wild with rage and alcohol

95
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,750
Buddha's disciples they panic

96
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,250
they scatter they're shouting Run Buddha run

97
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,416
but Buddha doesn't move

98
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,416
he just stands there completely calm

99
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,208
watching this multi ton killing machine

100
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,708
charging straight at him

101
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,250
and then something impossible happens

102
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,250
as Nalagiri gets closer Buddha doesn't run

103
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,500
doesn't fight doesn't even flinch

104
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,583
instead he radiates pure

105
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,375
loving kindness directly toward this raging elephant

106
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,333
and Nalagiri suddenly stops

107
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,250
just stops right in front of Buddha

108
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,875
the elephant's eyes clear

109
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:43,666
the rage disappears and this massive creature slowly

110
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,833
gently kneels down like it's bowing

111
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,625
Buddha reaches out touches the elephant's trunk

112
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:50,916
speaks gently

113
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,333
the Dhammapada teaches :

114
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,166
and in that moment

115
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,125
Buddha didn't fight the elephant he loved him

116
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,625
this isn't just legend

117
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,333
these events are recorded in the Vinaya Pitaka

118
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,541
one of the oldest collections of Buddhist

119
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,750
monastic rules

120
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,875
it happened the crowd is in shock

121
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,625
the elephant keepers are in shock

122
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,125
even Buddha's disciples are stunned

123
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,000
but Devadatta he's furious

124
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,375
his perfect murder plan

125
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,416
just made his cousin look even more divine

126
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,583
but Devadatta wasn't giving up he was escalating

127
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,791
the elephant plan failed spectacularly

128
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,333
so Devadatta decides

129
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,000
if I can't use an animal to kill him

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll do it myself

131
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,250
this time he's calculated personal

132
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,041
he studies Buddha's routines

133
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,250
looking for the perfect opportunity

134
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,750
he finds it on Vulture Peak

135
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,750
Buddha's favorite meditation spot

136
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,958
Buddha goes there regularly to teach

137
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,916
to find peace it's his sanctuary

138
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,875
and Devadatta is about to turn it into a crime scene

139
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,291
Buddha's walking up the mountain path

140
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,291
completely absorbed in meditation

141
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,833
completely trusting

142
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,125
Devadatta's already there

143
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,250
hiding behind rocks waiting

144
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,791
he's found the perfect boulder

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,500
massive heavy enough to crush a person instantly

146
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,916
positioned right above where Buddha always walks

147
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,708
Buddha's climbing slowly peacefully

148
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,500
disciples following behind

149
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,041
enjoying the mountain air

150
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,083
they have no idea that 30 feet above them

151
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,291
Buddha's own cousin is crouched behind a rock

152
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,041
hands on a boulder waiting

153
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,000
then Devadatta sees his chance

154
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,583
Buddha's directly below him

155
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,083
no escape route perfect positioning

156
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,500
Devadatta pushes this massive boulder

157
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,708
starts rolling bouncing

158
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,666
picking up speed heading straight for Buddha's head

159
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,500
but then something impossible happens again

160
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,916
just as this rock is about to crush Buddha

161
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,875
it hits another rock and splits perfectly in half

162
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,541
most of it crashes harmlessly aside

163
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,083
but one sharp fragment cuts Buddha's foot

164
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,041
drawing blood

165
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,416
the Cullavagga part of the ancient monastic texts

166
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,125
tells us this wasn't symbolic

167
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,000
it happened and it left a mark

168
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,375
so Devadata actually succeeded partially

169
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,625
he became the first

170
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,708
and only person to make Buddha bleed

171
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,458
but instead of celebrating

172
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,833
something else happens

173
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,916
Buddha stops looks at his bleeding foot

174
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,708
then looks up directly at Devadatta's hiding spot

175
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,333
their eyes meet Buddha's expression

176
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,833
isn't anger isn't fear

177
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,666
it's sadness pure

178
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,791
deep sadness like he's looking at a lost child

179
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,708
who's fallen so far from Grace

180
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,291
Buddha doesn't call out doesn't accuse

181
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,500
doesn't seek revenge

182
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,750
he wraps his foot and continues walking

183
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,916
like nothing happened

184
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,208
and this drives Devadatta absolutely insane

185
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,875
Buddha's complete lack of retaliation

186
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,500
makes him look even more petty

187
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,583
more evil more isolated

188
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,875
if he couldn't kill Buddha with rocks

189
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,125
he needed professionals

190
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,208
two failed attempts

191
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,250
and Devadata's running out of sanity

192
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,666
this time he's not going solo

193
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,875
he's recruiting help professional help

194
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,791
enter King Ajatashatru

195
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,416
ruler of one of India's most powerful kingdoms

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,166
Devadatta approaches him with a proposal

197
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,666
you control the people I'll control the monks

198
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,291
together we rule everything

199
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,583
the king hungry for absolute power agrees

200
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,916
but their murder plot is diabolical

201
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,458
they recruit an assassin with poisoned fingernails

202
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,666
yeah that was actually a thing

203
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,500
one scratch and within hours

204
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,250
you're dead no weapons

205
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,291
no obvious murder but Devadatta is paranoid

206
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,125
so he recruits backup assassins

207
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,791
if the first fails

208
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,291
they kill Buddha and the first assassin

209
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,666
if those fail more assassins kill everyone

210
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,875
it's like a murder pyramid scheme

211
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,750
the first assassin approaches Buddha

212
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,833
during his teaching gets close

213
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,666
raises his poisoned hand ready for that fatal scratch

214
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,250
but then something extraordinary happens

215
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,875
the moment this killer looks into Buddha's eyes

216
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,291
hears his voice

217
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,500
something inside him breaks

218
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,291
this professional murderer

219
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,875
throws himself at Buddha's feet

220
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:24,083
confesses everything reveals the entire plot

221
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,416
Devadatta the king

222
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:27,666
everyone

223
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,583
Buddha's response

224
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,041
he doesn't call for guards or demand justice

225
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,375
he looks at this assassin and says

226
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,625
your honesty has saved you

227
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,208
go in peace

228
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,166
just like that Buddha converts

229
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,458
a professional killer into a peaceful monk

230
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,041
but it gets better

231
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,375
all the backup assassins witness this

232
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,000
one by one they come forward confess

233
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,041
ask for forgiveness within hours

234
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,041
Devadatta's entire murder squad has

235
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,416
become Buddha's disciples

236
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,125
King Ajatasatru hears what happened and panics

237
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,333
he's just been exposed as an assassination conspirator

238
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,541
but Buddha sends a message

239
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,083
the king is forgiven let him rule in peace

240
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,583
no revenge no retaliation

241
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,708
just forgiveness

242
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,333
and this finally breaks something inside Devadatta

243
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,625
every attempt to destroy Buddha

244
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,500
has only made him look more divine

245
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,291
more worthy of worship

246
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,791
but if he couldn't destroy the teacher

247
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,000
maybe he could destroy the teaching itself

248
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,250
three failed assassinations

249
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,208
and Devadatta finally realizes

250
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,875
Buddha is impossible to kill

251
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,291
so he changes tactics

252
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,791
if I can't destroy the man

253
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,041
I'll destroy his movement

254
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,083
from the inside

255
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,583
Devadatta approaches Buddha

256
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,291
with improvements to Buddhism

257
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,041
in front of hundreds of monks

258
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,791
he announces stricter rules

259
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,583
all monks should live in forests forever

260
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,416
only eat begged food wear only rags

261
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,375
sleep under trees never eat meat

262
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,166
sounds holy right

263
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,000
but Buddha sees through this

264
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,500
Devadata is trying to make Buddhism so extreme

265
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,708
that only fanatical monks will remain

266
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,333
monks he can control

267
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,916
Buddha's response is masterful

268
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,583
these are good suggestions

269
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,083
for those who wish to follow them

270
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,583
but they should be optional

271
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,000
not mandatory

272
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,083
with that simple response

273
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,166
Buddha deflates Devadatta's power grab

274
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,916
but Devadatta's prepared

275
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,250
he's been secretly recruiting younger monks

276
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,625
convincing them Buddha's become too soft

277
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,750
too commercial

278
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,375
he stands up and declares Buddha's lost his way

279
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,625
he's too old too comfortable

280
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,625
I'll lead the true followers

281
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,166
and it works sort of

282
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,000
about 500 young monks follow him

283
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,250
impressed by his charisma and promises of pure Buddhism

284
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,458
imagine Buddha's heartbreak

285
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,500
watching his own cousin

286
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,291
lead away hundreds of disciples

287
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,500
claiming to be the real Buddhist leader

288
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,666
but Buddha doesn't argue doesn't fight back

289
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,958
he simply continues teaching

290
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,625
demonstrating through actions

291
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,458
what true Buddhism looks like

292
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,166
and his silence speaks louder than any argument

293
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,541
within weeks those 500 monks notice something

294
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,833
without Buddha around to compete with

295
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:15,000
Devadatta shows his true nature controlling

296
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,000
demanding obsessed with rules and punishment

297
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,708
the pure Buddhism Devadatta promised

298
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,833
it turns into a cult of fear

299
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,000
question him and you're punished

300
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,083
compassion gets replaced by control

301
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,291
one by one the monks return to Buddha apologizing

302
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,750
asking for forgiveness Buddha welcomes them back

303
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,875
no questions no punishments

304
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,958
no lectures

305
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,250
just welcome home

306
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,250
but for Devadatta watching his followers abandon him

307
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,500
this realization comes too late

308
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,958
the karma he's been building is about to explode

309
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,625
Devadatta's failed at everything

310
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,333
murder conspiracy

311
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:03,125
community splitting he's alone abandoned

312
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,458
exposed as a fraud

313
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,791
but the universe isn't done with him yet

314
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,875
according to Buddhist teachings

315
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,291
some actions create ānantariya karma

316
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,083
immediate consequences

317
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,791
attacking an awakened being

318
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,333
that's one of them

319
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,041
and Devadatta was about to find out why

320
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,625
strange things start happening

321
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,875
Devadata develops a mysterious illness

322
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,375
his body breaking down not from disease

323
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,041
but like his own hatred is eating him from the inside

324
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,958
his skin becomes covered in painful boils

325
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,208
his strength fails he's constantly feverish

326
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,166
the physical symptoms are nothing

327
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,833
compared to what's happening mentally

328
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,541
he starts having nightmares

329
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,708
where he's chased by the very elephants and boulders

330
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,500
he used against Buddha he can't sleep

331
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,625
can't eat can't find peace

332
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,708
people report supernatural events around him

333
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,500
ground shaking when he walks

334
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:58,000
animals fleeing plants withering in his presence

335
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:01,416
it's like the natural world is rejecting him

336
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,791
but Buddha knowing everything Devadatta has done

337
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,416
does something incredible

338
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,333
he visits his dying cousin

339
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,291
the man Devadatta tried to murder three times

340
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,041
walks into the room

341
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,708
where his cousin is being consumed by his own karma

342
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,791
seeing Buddha approach Devadatta panics

343
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,333
he knows he's dying

344
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,000
and his last chance for redemption is

345
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,791
standing right there he tries to get up

346
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,791
tries to bow but his body's too weak

347
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,458
he manages to raise his hands

348
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,083
and whispers with his dying breath

349
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,500
I take refuge in Buddha

350
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,958
Buddha places his hand on Devadatta's forehead

351
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,666
your recognition of truth creates merit

352
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,583
you are not completely lost

353
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,875
Devadatta dies right there

354
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,583
but with that final surrender

355
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,541
he creates just enough positive karma

356
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,625
to avoid the worst possible rebirth

357
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,375
but his death isn't quiet

358
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,916
the ancient texts say

359
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,750
the earth cracked open beneath him

360
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,583
thunder boomed flames erupted

361
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,083
it was like nature itself cried out

362
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,875
this is what happens when love turns to hate

363
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,708
Buddha's reaction to watching his cousin

364
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,500
swallowed by the earth not Celebration

365
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,875
not vindication grief pure heartbroken grief

366
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,416
he remembers the little boy

367
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,333
who played with him in palace court yards

368
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,041
taught him archery shared his royal childhood

369
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,125
somewhere inside that twisted man

370
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,625
that innocent child still existed

371
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,500
Buddha later tells his disciples

372
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,208
Devadatta was consumed by the three poisons greed

373
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,916
hatred and delusion but even in his final moment

374
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:38,625
he showed that awakening is possible for everyone

375
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,750
then Buddha says something that changes everything

376
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:45,125
Devadatta was my teacher as much as I was his

377
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,166
he taught me compassion by showing me hatred

378
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,083
patience by testing mine

379
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,750
forgiveness by doing the unforgivable

380
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,208
so what does this 2,500 year old family drama

381
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,541
teach us about dealing with toxic people today

382
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,541
first toxic people aren't born evil

383
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,208
Devadatta was consumed by the 3 poisons

384
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,083
greed for power hatred from jealousy

385
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,083
and delusion about his own righteousness

386
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,791
think about your own toxic family members

387
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,458
aren't they usually driven by these same forces

388
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,750
second fighting toxic people only makes them more toxic

389
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,291
every time Buddha could have retaliated

390
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,208
he chose compassion instead

391
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,000
that choice led to Devadatta's self destruction

392
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,000
Buddha didn't defeat his enemy

393
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,958
his enemy defeated himself

394
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,083
what would happen if you stopped fighting back

395
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,625
against your toxic relatives

396
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,708
third your worst enemies can be your greatest teachers

397
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,875
Buddha said Devadatta forced him to

398
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,000
practice compassion at the highest level

399
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,208
your toxic family members aren't just obstacles

400
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,916
they're your training ground for becoming more patient

401
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,208
forgiving and wise

402
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,708
fourth everyone has potential for redemption

403
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,833
even Devadatta in his final breath

404
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,416
found enough light to save himself from the worst fate

405
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,666
nobody is beyond hope

406
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,833
finally you can't control others actions

407
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,291
only your responses

408
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,208
Buddha couldn't stop the assassination attempts

409
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,875
but he could choose how to respond

410
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,875
with love instead of revenge

411
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,375
that choice made all the difference

412
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,125
remember what the Buddha said

413
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,291
hatred does not cease by hatred

414
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,666
but only by love that wasn't just a line

415
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,750
he lived it and so can we

416
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,500
next time someone close betrays you

417
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,041
remember Buddha and Devadatta

418
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,541
your response not their action

419
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,125
determines who you become

420
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,750
will you let their poison consume you

421
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,208
or will you choose the path that sets you free

422
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,958
choose compassion not because they deserve it

423
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,375
but because you do

424
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,125
you deserve freedom from hatred's poison

425
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,625
if this story changed how you think about forgiveness

00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,250
