1
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,875
imagine waking up tomorrow and you don't exist anymore

2
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,333
not your body that's still there

3
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,166
not your awareness you're still conscious

4
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:20,375
but the you that you think you are completely gone

5
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,291
your personality your life story

6
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:27,666
your insecurities your grudges all vanished

7
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,333
according to Buddha

8
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,041
this isn't just some philosophical thought experiment

9
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,291
it's the doorway to the greatest freedom

10
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,708
you'll ever experience

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,666
what's up wisdom seekers Matt here

12
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,166
today we're diving into Buddhism's most mind bending

13
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,666
teaching one that flips everything you think

14
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,625
you know about yourself upside down

15
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,500
we've touched on non self in previous videos

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,125
but today we're going all in on the big question

17
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,083
think about it every day

18
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:05,791
you wake up thinking

19
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,583
you're the same person you were yesterday

20
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,916
you have this story about who you are

21
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,333
maybe you're the funny one

22
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,625
the responsible one the anxious one

23
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,833
whatever you protect this identity at all costs

24
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,333
when someone criticizes you

25
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:18,750
it hurts

26
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,875
because they're attacking the self you've built

27
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,333
but what if this solid

28
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,458
unchanging you doesn't actually exist

29
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,000
what if it's more like a character in a play

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,958
that you've been performing so long

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,541
you forgot you were acting

32
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:37,625
the Buddha discovered something radical 2,500 years ago

33
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,791
that modern neuroscience is only now confirming

34
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,541
this sense of a permanent

35
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:45,416
separate self is actually an illusion

36
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:49,541
created by our brains and when this illusion falls away

37
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,583
something absolutely incredible happens

38
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,083
now this teaching of non self

39
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,583
or anatta in Pali

40
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,166
is one of Buddhism's three marks of existence

41
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:05,000
alongside impermanence anicca and suffering dukkha

42
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,250
these three insights form

43
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,416
the foundation of the Buddha's

44
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,791
revolutionary understanding of reality

45
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,083
while other spiritual traditions

46
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,958
were busy describing the eternal soul

47
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,458
or unchanging self

48
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,000
the Buddha turned this idea on its head

49
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,500
he taught that seeing

50
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,625
through the illusion of a permanent self

51
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:25,375
was the key to liberation from suffering

52
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,541
so for the next 20 minutes

53
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,375
I invite you to hold your sense of self

54
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,583
a little more lightly

55
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,000
we're about to explore what shifts

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,166
what opens up

57
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,791
and what becomes possible when you don't exist

58
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:41,000
and trust me it's way more exciting than it is scary

59
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,041
let's start with what actually happens

60
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,625
in those rare moments

61
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,458
when your sense of self temporarily vanishes

62
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,333
have you ever been so absorbed in something

63
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,958
maybe playing music or being in nature

64
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:00,000
or even just watching a sunset

65
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,208
that you completely forgot about yourself

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,833
no thoughts about how you look

67
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,750
what you need to do later or who you are

68
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:12,750
just pure experience with no you at the center of it

69
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,541
as the Zen master Dogen said

70
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,708
these are glimpses of non self

71
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,083
and they happen more often than you might think

72
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,416
take Alex

73
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,166
a surfer from California who described his experience

74
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:34,625
I caught this perfect wave and suddenly there was no me

75
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:35,708
surfing anymore

76
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,583
there was just surfing happening

77
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,375
complete oneness with the wave

78
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,333
it was the most peaceful and alive I've ever felt

79
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,458
this isn't just random neuroscientists have found that

80
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,875
during these flow states

81
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,666
activity in the part of your brain

82
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,875
responsible for self referential thinking

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,125
actually drops significantly

84
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,833
your brain literally stops generating the sense of you

85
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,416
for a while the Buddha put it simply

86
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,708
what's fascinating is

87
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,291
what people consistently report

88
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,250
feeling in these moments profound peace

89
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,000
unexpected joy and a sense of connection to everything

90
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,958
not the jittery happiness we usually chase

91
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,625
like a dog after its tail

92
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,875
but something deeper like

93
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,000
finally remembering a name

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,208
that's been on the tip of your tongue

95
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,583
your entire life

96
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,250
as the famous Zen saying goes

97
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,625
but the difference is there's no you doing the chopping

98
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,083
the Buddha taught that

99
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,958
these aren't just nice experiences

100
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,583
they're actually glimpses of our natural state

101
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,583
when the illusion of a separate self

102
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,208
temporarily drops away

103
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,708
so what's actually happening in these moments

104
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,416
when you disappear

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,708
time perception changes

106
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,833
everything feels like it's happening in an eternal now

107
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,791
boundaries dissolve

108
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,916
the line between you and everything else

109
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,125
gets very blurry

110
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:10,958
fear vanishes

111
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,000
because there's no separate self to protect

112
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,500
effort drops

113
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,375
things just seem to happen effortlessly through you

114
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,791
rather than by you

115
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,291
the contemporary Buddhist teacher

116
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,250
Adyashanti describes it perfectly

117
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,291
but here's where it gets really interesting

118
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,708
what if these weren't just fleeting moments

119
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,833
what if this was available as a more stable realization

120
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,000
what if you could function in daily life

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
from this place of no solid self

122
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,083
this is exactly what the Buddhist path is pointing

123
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,250
toward not just glimpses

124
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,958
but a fundamental shift in how you experience reality

125
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,833
so now that we know what these moments feel like

126
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,000
let's explore the freedom that comes

127
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,750
when the prison of self begins to dissolve

128
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,875
think about how much of your life is spent defending

129
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:15,500
maintaining

130
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,791
and worrying about this self you think you are

131
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,250
when someone criticizes you

132
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,833
it hurts because they're attacking your self image

133
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,125
when you compare yourself to others

134
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,333
you're measuring yourself against theirs

135
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,916
when you replay embarrassing moments from years ago

136
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:30,958
at 3:00am

137
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,916
you're protecting the story of who you think you are

138
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,125
the Buddha called this constant maintenance dukkha

139
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,166
commonly translated as suffering

140
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,750
but it's more like a persistent unease

141
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:46,333
a background anxiety that never fully goes away

142
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,125
as long as there's a you to protect

143
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,791
so what happens when this self disappears

144
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,208
freedom happens

145
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,000
as Thich Nhat Hanh beautifully put it

146
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,125
last year I was hiking in the mountains

147
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,375
completely absorbed in work problems

148
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,625
then a bird call snapped me into the present moment

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,333
in that instant

150
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,000
Matt with all his problems vanished

151
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,708
there was just awareness

152
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,625
experiencing the mountain

153
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,875
the sky

154
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,250
the sound

155
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,833
no separation

156
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,083
just life happening

157
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,875
the relief was incredible

158
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,500
like putting down a heavy backpack

159
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
I didn't even realize I was carrying

160
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,833
this is what the Buddha was pointing to

161
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,416
when the self disappears

162
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,916
the constant inner critic finally shuts up

163
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,875
because there's no you to criticize

164
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,958
embarrassment fades away

165
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,416
because there's no reputation to protect

166
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,750
the need to be special vanishes

167
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,416
because there's no you that needs to stand out

168
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,333
the fear of failure dissolves

169
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,375
because there is no you that can fail

170
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,666
the 12th century Zen master Dogen wrote

171
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,583
and your place is precisely where the separate self

172
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:14,416
ends

173
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,541
one participant in our meditation retreat

174
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,000
described it this way

175
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,833
it was like I'd been holding my breath my entire life

176
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,708
and finally exhaled I realized that what I called me

177
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,625
was actually just a collection of thoughts

178
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,125
I was desperately clinging to

179
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,250
neuroscience gives us some interesting insights here

180
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,000
too studies of experienced meditators

181
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,375
show reduced activity in the areas of the brain

182
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,541
associated with self referential thinking

183
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:41,500
and increased

184
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,041
activity in areas associated with awareness

185
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,750
and present moment attention

186
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,708
in other words as the self construct weakens

187
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,958
awareness actually expands

188
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,875
but here's an important point

189
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:55,250
this

190
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,458
freedom doesn't mean you become an emotional zombie

191
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,000
or lose your personality

192
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,875
actually quite the opposite

193
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,083
when you're not constantly maintaining

194
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,791
a rigid sense of self you become more spontaneous

195
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,041
more authentic more alive

196
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,500
without a fixed self to defend

197
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,000
you're free to respond to each moment freshly

198
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,333
without the burden of how I should be

199
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,875
or what others expect of me

200
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,041
the Zen teacher Shunryu Suzuki explained it perfectly

201
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,500
so if there's no solid 'me' behind the wheel

202
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,750
what happens when you grab coffee with friends

203
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,125
or argue with your partner

204
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,208
that's where things get really interesting

205
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,416
now let's talk about something we all care about

206
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,583
relationships

207
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,291
what happens to your connections with others

208
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,708
when you don't exist

209
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,875
think about the last argument you had

210
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,208
with someone close to you

211
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,125
chances are it revolved around defending your position

212
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,416
your feelings your perspective

213
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:05,166
you hurt me you don't understand my needs

214
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,333
you don't appreciate what I do for you

215
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,916
what if all those 'me's and 'my's

216
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,625
were suddenly not so solid

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,666
when non self is realized

218
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,250
relationships transform in remarkable ways

219
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,916
as the Buddha taught

220
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,250
first comparison and competition naturally fade away

221
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,125
when there's no solid you to compare with others

222
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,250
the exhausting game of one-upmanship ends

223
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,708
you no longer need to be prettier

224
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,375
smarter wealthier

225
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,000
or more successful than others

226
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,708
because there's no separate you that needs to win

227
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,416
Jason a longtime meditator

228
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,666
shared this experience

229
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,166
after years of fighting with my brother

230
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,875
over who was more successful

231
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,916
something shifted during one family gathering

232
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:58,875
I realized

233
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,083
there was no me that needed to prove anything

234
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:05,125
our whole rivalry just dissolved

235
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,166
now we're closer than ever

236
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:12,291
second genuine empathy naturally arises

237
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,958
without the barrier of a separate self

238
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,750
you directly experience others joy and suffering

239
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,416
as not separate from your own

240
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,958
compassion becomes less of an effort

241
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,083
and more of a natural response

242
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,375
the Dalai Lama explains it this way

243
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,500
third relationships become less needy

244
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,041
when you're not looking to others

245
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,541
to complete your sense of self

246
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,291
or validate your existence

247
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,416
connections become more authentic and less burdened

248
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,000
think about this

249
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,500
how many of your relationship problems

250
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,208
stem from seeking validation

251
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,708
recognition or completion from others

252
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,916
what if you approached relationships

253
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,666
without needing anything from them

254
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,541
just showing up fully present

255
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,750
research in psychology confirms this

256
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,916
studies show that the strongest relationships

257
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,416
aren't based on dependency

258
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,000
or completing each other

259
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,375
but on two whole people choosing to share their journey

260
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:18,375
fourth conflicts transform when there's no me to defend

261
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,500
disagreements stop being personal

262
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,791
you can disagree with someone without making them wrong

263
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,333
and you right you can even incorporate

264
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,166
their perspective into your understanding

265
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,458
creating something new together

266
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:35,541
as Thich Nhat Hanh reminds us in true dialogue

267
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,500
both sides are willing to change

268
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,083
this doesn't mean you become a doormat

269
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,500
or lose your boundaries actually

270
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,000
boundaries become clearer and healthier

271
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,458
because they're no longer emotionally charged

272
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,166
defenses of a fragile self

273
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,333
they're just practical parameters for interaction

274
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,333
but wait if there's no me running the show

275
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,833
who's going to remember to pick up the dry cleaning

276
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,000
who's going to show up for work on Monday

277
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,250
let's get practical about this whole no self business

278
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,000
now I know what you're thinking

279
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,125
this all sounds nice in theory Matt

280
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,541
but how does this actually work in real life

281
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,208
who gets up and goes to work if there's no me

282
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,625
who makes decisions who takes responsibility

283
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,833
these are great questions

284
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,583
and they bring us to the practical side of non self

285
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,125
the common misconception is that without a self

286
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,416
you just sit around doing nothing

287
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,250
or float aimlessly through life with no direction

288
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,416
but that's not at all what happens

289
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,000
as the Zen master Linji put it

290
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,291
the profound

291
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,375
simplicity of this teaching points to action

292
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,875
without the complication of a self centered narrative

293
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,291
the difference is in the who that's doing the action

294
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,875
or more accurately the absence of a who

295
00:13:58,833 --> 00:13:59,208
so

296
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,375
what does this actually look like on a Tuesday morning

297
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,708
when you're stuck in traffic

298
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,458
your life continues

299
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,666
but without that extra layer of 'me-ness'

300
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,791
clogging everything up decisions still happen

301
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,250
but they arise from wisdom and conditions rather

302
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,625
than ego preferences

303
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,125
responsibilities are still fulfilled

304
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,916
often more effectively

305
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,166
because there's no self centered resistance to them

306
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,333
goals can still be pursued

307
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,708
but without the desperate attachment to outcomes

308
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,375
the Buddha himself

309
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,083
was incredibly active after his Enlightenment

310
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,583
teaching for 45 years establishing a monastic order

311
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,333
traveling extensively

312
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,916
clearly function doesn't stop when self dissolves

313
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,000
neuroscience gives us interesting insights here too

314
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:43,750
studies show that

315
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,875
when experienced meditators perform tasks

316
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,375
from a state of non self

317
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,500
their performance often improves

318
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,541
there's less second guessing

319
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,708
less performance anxiety

320
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,250
and more direct engagement with the task at hand

321
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,541
think about athletes in the zone

322
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,958
or musicians who become one with their instrument

323
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,791
they're functioning at their peak

324
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,125
precisely when the self steps out of the way

325
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,875
as the legendary basketball coach Phil Jackson

326
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:12,333
who incorporated Zen teachings into his coaching said

327
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,583
but what about morality if there's no me

328
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,833
what prevents harmful actions

329
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,000
this is where many people misunderstand non self

330
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,083
the realization of non self doesn't eliminate ethics

331
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,625
it transforms them

332
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,125
when you don't see yourself as separate from others

333
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,041
causing harm makes less and less sense

334
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,000
compassionate action emerges naturally

335
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,666
not because you should be good

336
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,083
but because you directly experience others suffering

337
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,708
as not separate from your own

338
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,375
The 8th century Buddhist master

339
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,916
Shantideva put it beautifully

340
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,583
so in practical terms

341
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:07,125
living from non self might look like working diligently

342
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,958
but without identifying as the hard working one

343
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,541
loving deeply but without possessiveness or need

344
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:17,625
creating art or music but without needing recognition

345
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,875
helping others

346
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,250
without seeing them as separate from yourself

347
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,583
it's not that personality disappears

348
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,458
it's more that you hold it lightly

349
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:27,500
like a costume

350
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,625
you can wear wholeheartedly without forgetting

351
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,916
you can take it off

352
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,625
you see your personality in the mirror of everyday life

353
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,750
but you no longer mistake the reflection

354
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,000
for who's doing the looking

355
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,583
you wear your identity

356
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,583
like an interesting mask at a party

357
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,708
fully engaged in the character

358
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,375
but secretly smiling at the game of it all

359
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,583
okay so we can still function without a solid me

360
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,166
great but the Buddha wasn't teaching this

361
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,500
just so we could be more effective at our jobs

362
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,708
he was pointing to something much bigger

363
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,875
we've talked about glimpses of non self

364
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,500
the freedom it brings how it transforms relationships

365
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,125
and how it works practically

366
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,958
but now let's explore what the Buddha considered

367
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,875
the ultimate purpose of this teaching

368
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,625
complete liberation

369
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,208
the Buddha didn't teach non self as an interesting

370
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,166
philosophical concept he taught it as medicine

371
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,041
for the fundamental disease of human existence

372
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:28,458
suffering

373
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,750
he recognized that at the root of all our suffering

374
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,958
lies this mistaken belief in a separate

375
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,166
permanent self

376
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,000
and when this illusion is completely seen through

377
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,958
something profound happens

378
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,416
in Buddhist terminology

379
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,875
this complete liberation is called Nirvana

380
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,208
literally meaning

381
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,458
blowing out like a flame being extinguished

382
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,416
but what's being extinguished isn't you

383
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,000
it's the illusion of a separate self

384
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:55,708
it's like

385
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,500
you've been wearing noise cancelling headphones

386
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,166
your entire life and suddenly they're removed

387
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,625
the world explodes into symphonic clarity

388
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,875
that was always there

389
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,250
as the Buddha said

390
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,166
so what actually changes

391
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,000
when this ultimate liberation occurs

392
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,041
first fear

393
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,500
especially fear of death dramatically transforms

394
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,416
when you deeply realize

395
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,375
there was never a permanent you to begin with

396
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:32,541
the terror of losing this you naturally subsides

397
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,625
death is still respected

398
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,708
but it's seen more as a transition than an end

399
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,333
the Tibetan Buddhist master

400
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,541
Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche explained

401
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,208
second

402
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,875
suffering takes on a completely different quality

403
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,416
the Buddha never claimed that physical pain

404
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,000
would disappear with enlightenment

405
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,791
but he did teach that the mental suffering

406
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,166
we add to our experience the resistance

407
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,958
the aversion the craving

408
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,208
can completely cease

409
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,333
imagine experiencing life's challenges

410
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,125
without the added layer of

411
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,916
why is this happening to me

412
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,541
I don't deserve this

413
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,375
Doctor Mark Epstein a psychiatrist

414
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,750
who integrates Buddhist thinking with psychology

415
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,750
describes it as the freedom to be nobody

416
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,000
there's an incredible lightness

417
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,916
in not having to be somebody special all the time

418
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,166
third a natural joy emerges

419
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,500
not the excited grasping happiness we usually chase

420
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,541
but a profound contentment that's always available

421
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,125
regardless of external circumstances

422
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,500
the Thai Forest master Ajahn Chah

423
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,541
called it the peace that comes from letting go

424
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,083
fourth perception itself fundamentally shifts

425
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,791
the world doesn't change

426
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,000
but how you experience it transforms completely

427
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,708
instead of seeing separate objects and people

428
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,833
you directly perceive the interconnected

429
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,791
nature of everything

430
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,000
boundaries become permeable fluid

431
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,791
more like convenient designations

432
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,125
than ultimate realities

433
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,791
the contemporary teacher

434
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,500
Adyashanti describes it as the end of your world

435
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,916
not in an apocalyptic sense

436
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,000
but in the sense that the world

437
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,750
as you've constructed it falls away

438
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,041
revealing what was always here

439
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,750
but perhaps the most significant shift is this

440
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,833
the seeking finally stops

441
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,583
the constant feeling that something is missing

442
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,208
that you need to become something more

443
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,958
that fulfillment is around the next corner

444
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:49,041
comes to an end as the ancient Chan master Linji said

445
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,708
this doesn't mean you become passive or complacent

446
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:14,250
quite the opposite without the self centered filters

447
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,500
you're able to respond to life directly

448
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,958
spontaneously compassionately

449
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,375
without the hesitation and confusion that

450
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,916
comes from self concern

451
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,500
so what does all this mean for you

452
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,041
watching this right now

453
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,125
it means that this freedom

454
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,083
this peace

455
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,541
this clarity isn't something distant or theoretical

456
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,666
it's your birthright it's what you already are

457
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,916
when the illusion of a separate self falls away

458
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,916
as the Buddha said in his final teaching

459
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,416
so now let's wrap this all up with a mystery

460
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,833
that might just change everything

461
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,625
so we've explored what happens when you don't exist

462
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,125
we've seen how the self is more like a process

463
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,000
than a thing

464
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,500
how freedom emerges when this illusion is seen

465
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,208
through how relationships transform

466
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,416
how we can function practically

467
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,333
and the ultimate liberation this points toward

468
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,625
but here's the cosmic joke that the Buddha discovered

469
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,916
under the Bodhi Tree

470
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,750
the self spends its entire existence

471
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,708
desperately trying to

472
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,083
protect itself from something that never happens

473
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,625
because that self never truly existed

474
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:26,916
in the first place

475
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:28,791
it's like spending your life

476
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,541
afraid of monsters under the bed

477
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,791
and then one day finally looking underneath

478
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,208
only to discover there was never anything there

479
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,041
this leaves us with a profound mystery

480
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,875
if you're not who you think you are

481
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,083
then what's really living this life

482
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,250
if you're not your thoughts

483
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,583
they come and go while awareness remains

484
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,541
if you're not your emotions

485
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,500
they change constantly while awareness watches

486
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,375
if you're not your body

487
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,125
every cell is replaced over time

488
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:00,500
if you're not your memories or life story

489
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,875
which change and fade

490
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,291
then what are you the answer can't be put into words

491
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:08,708
because words and concepts are tools of the thinking

492
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:11,916
mind and this mystery lies beyond thinking

493
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,250
it can only be discovered through direct experience

494
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:16,208
by looking

495
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,125
deeply into the nature of your own awareness

496
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,958
as the great Zen master Huineng said

497
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:27,375
this isn't nihilism it's not saying nothing exists

498
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,583
it's pointing to a profound reality

499
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,416
beyond our conceptual frameworks

500
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:34,000
beyond the stories we tell about ourselves

501
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,125
the invitation of Buddhism isn't to believe in non

502
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,416
self as a concept

503
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,875
but to investigate your direct experience right now

504
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,666
to look deeply into this sense of I

505
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,333
and see what's really there

506
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,958
the Zen tradition calls this the great death

507
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,791
not the death of the body

508
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,708
but the death of the illusion of a separate self

509
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,500
and what's discovered through this great death

510
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,250
is what some traditions call

511
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,875
your original face what you were before you were born

512
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:04,458
what you've always been

513
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:06,875
beneath the costumes and masks of identity

514
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,958
I invite you to get curious about this

515
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:11,916
to wonder

516
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:17,125
to investigate not intellectually but experientially

517
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,166
what if you didn't have to wait for enlightenment

518
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,541
to experience freedom

519
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,000
what if you could taste it right now

520
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:27,458
by simply pausing and noticing that awareness

521
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:30,541
which is already present already complete

522
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,916
already free of a separate self

523
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:37,250
because when the illusion of you falls away

524
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,750
you stop surviving and start being

525
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:42,333
you stop performing and start living

526
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:45,500
as the contemporary teacher Rupert Spira puts it

527
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,625
I invite you to sit quietly for a moment

528
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:56,250
close your eyes if you're comfortable doing so

529
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,500
and simply notice

530
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,250
who or what is aware of your current experience

531
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,291
not what you're aware of

532
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:05,000
but what is this awareness itself

533
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,833
and I'll leave you with that question

534
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:09,500
to explore in your own time

535
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:11,125
because that exploration

536
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:13,125
is the heart of the Buddhist path

537
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:16,708
have you ever experienced a moment when you disappeared

538
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:18,833
share in the comments below

539
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,791
I read every single one

540
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:23,291
and would love to hear about your experiences

541
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:28,083
and remember the next time you find yourself stressed

542
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:30,166
anxious or caught in self concern

543
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:31,958
just pause and ask yourself

544
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,125
what happens when I don't exist

545
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:36,708
you might be surprised at the freedom

546
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,208
that question opens up

547
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:42,583
until next time stay curious

548
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,875
stay wise and remember

549
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,000
you might be less you than you think

550
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,666
and that's the best news you'll ever receive
