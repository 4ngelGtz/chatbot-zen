1
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,541
what if death isn't the end but a doorway

2
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,875
imagine finding an ancient manual

3
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,541
not just for dying well but for living fully

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,250
a text so powerful that the Beatles

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,833
scientists and hospice centers worldwide use its wisdom

6
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,833
this isn't fiction this 1200 year old

7
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,083
Tibetan manuscript was deliberately hidden

8
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:31,041
for centuries waiting for us

9
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,791
they call it the Bardo Thödol

10
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,791
liberation through hearing

11
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,833
today I'll show you why this death manual

12
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,916
might be life's most practical guide

13
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:48,125
stay with me

14
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:51,250
to discover the hidden architecture of your own mind

15
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,875
The Tibetan Book of the dead

16
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,958
isn't just another religious text

17
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:59,333
it's a precise map of consciousness

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,500
revealing how your mind works

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,625
during both life's transitions

20
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,250
and death itself

21
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:09,083
I'm not just fascinated by its afterlife descriptions

22
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,208
but how it illuminates the transitions

23
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,166
we navigate every single day

24
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,791
those moments between anger and calm

25
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,500
between sleeping and waking

26
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:20,000
between one identity and another

27
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,916
the Tibetan tradition calls these bardos

28
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,041
and mastering them might be the key to freedom

29
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,333
for centuries

30
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:30,375
this wisdom was reserved for monastics and the dying

31
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:34,041
now scientists psychologists

32
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:34,916
and everyday people

33
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:38,000
are discovering its remarkable applications for living

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,500
I've spent a lot of time studying this text

35
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,125
and what I found will change how you experience

36
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,291
everything

37
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,000
you're in a Bardo right now

38
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,541
Bardo simply means in between state

39
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,458
those transitions from one experience to another

40
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,000
they're not just for death

41
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,000
they're happening throughout your life

42
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:04,666
the word comes from Tibetan "bar" means in between

43
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,041
and "do" means suspended or thrown

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,208
we're constantly moving through these transitions

45
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,000
whether we notice them or not

46
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,875
the Tibetan Book of the dead describes six bardos

47
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,041
the first three happen during life

48
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,541
the Bardo of life your ordinary

49
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:25,208
waking consciousness from birth until death

50
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,416
this is what you're experiencing right now

51
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,916
watching this video thinking about these concepts

52
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,833
feeling curious or skeptical

53
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,791
the Bardo of dreams

54
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,041
your consciousness during sleep and dreaming

55
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,250
this happens when you drift off tonight

56
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,458
those vivid dreams of flying

57
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,458
anxiety dreams about being unprepared

58
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,041
or strange moments

59
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,916
when you become aware you're dreaming

60
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,166
the Bardo of meditation

61
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,000
the shifts in awareness during deep contemplation

62
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,666
this happens when thoughts dissolve during meditation

63
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,208
when boundaries between yourself and the world soften

64
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,625
when you experience sudden clarity after confusion

65
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,166
the next three happen during and after death

66
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,083
the bardo of dying the moment of death transition

67
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,625
this begins with the dissolution of elements

68
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,208
during the dying process

69
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,000
and culminates in what the text describes

70
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,458
as the clear light of death

71
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,958
when all constructs dissolve

72
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,458
the Bardo of Dharmata

73
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,958
where consciousness encounters pure awareness

74
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:33,125
the text describes visions and experiences

75
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,833
representing our own psychological potentials

76
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,458
and karmic patterns

77
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,291
the bardo of becoming

78
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,625
where consciousness moves toward rebirth

79
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,250
a dreamlike state where future experience is shaped

80
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,083
by both past patterns and present responses

81
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,375
because recognizing these transitions

82
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,708
gives you power over your experience

83
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,666
most suffering comes from

84
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,625
not recognizing the temporary nature of these states

85
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:08,750
we mistake passing experiences for permanent reality

86
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,333
this wisdom

87
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,833
wasn't created to stay hidden in monasteries

88
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,500
it was deliberately preserved

89
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,791
to help people like us

90
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,458
navigate life's transitions with awareness

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,833
let me tell you how this manual came to be

92
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,416
The Tibetan Book of the dead

93
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,166
was composed by the legendary master

94
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,750
Padmasambhava in the 8th century

95
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,333
during Buddhism's earliest days in Tibet

96
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,458
but here's the fascinating part

97
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,375
he didn't publish it

98
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,583
he deliberately hid it as a terma

99
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,000
or treasure text

100
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,958
buried in caves

101
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,166
knowing it would be discovered centuries later

102
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,125
when humanity needed it most

103
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,458
it remained hidden for over 500 years

104
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,291
until a Tibetan mystic named Karma Lingpa

105
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,166
discovered it

106
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,083
while exploring sacred caves in central Tibet

107
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,541
this wasn't accidental

108
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,500
it was a time capsule meant for future generations

109
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,125
facing different challenges

110
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,208
now let's discover how to actually use this wisdom

111
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,750
in your daily life

112
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,750
let me share a simple method I call R.E.S.T.

113
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,291
R E

114
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,083
S T

115
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,166
that distills these ancient teachings

116
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,125
into something you can use today

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,041
R: Recognize the state you're in

118
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,166
E: Embrace the experience without resistance

119
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,916
S: See through its temporary nature

120
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,916
T: Transform by shifting your perspective

121
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:44,333
let's practice this right now with a common experience

122
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,541
anxiety before a presentation

123
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,916
first recognize this is anxiety arising

124
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,333
just name it clearly nervous thoughts appearing

125
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,416
racing heart happening

126
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,416
next embrace

127
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,750
instead of fighting the feelings

128
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,583
allow the sensations racing

129
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,000
heart tight chest

130
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,208
no judgment this

131
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,250
isn't about liking the experience

132
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,416
just not wasting energy fighting it

133
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,125
then see through

134
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,708
notice this state arose from specific conditions

135
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,541
and will pass when they change

136
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,291
it's not who you are it's a temporary Bardo state

137
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,000
flowing through your awareness

138
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,125
finally transform

139
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,333
shift your attention to the awareness

140
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,000
that notices these feelings

141
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,708
rather than being consumed by them

142
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,750
you're not the anxiety you're the knowing of it

143
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,083
I've used this practice in my own life

144
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,166
during intense transition periods

145
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:40,375
I remember during a particularly difficult breakup

146
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,375
I was caught in what seemed like endless grief

147
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,083
every morning I'd wake up with a heaviness

148
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,000
that followed me throughout the day

149
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:48,958
what changed

150
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,833
everything was recognizing this as a Bardo state

151
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,041
temporary transitional

152
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,375
not my fundamental identity

153
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:01,000
this recognition created space between me and grief

154
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,958
allowing me to work with it

155
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,125
rather than be consumed by it

156
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,500
let's try another example

157
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,291
anger during a traffic jam

158
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,875
RECOGNIZE: anger arising frustration happening

159
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,333
EMBRACE: feel the heat in your face

160
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,875
the tightness in your body

161
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,166
don't suppress it or act it out

162
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,291
SEE THROUGH: notice how this state was triggered

163
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,833
by specific conditions and will change

164
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,166
5 minutes ago you weren't angry

165
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,041
5 minutes from now you might not be either

166
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:35,208
TRANSFORM: rest is the awareness that notices the anger

167
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,000
rather than becoming the anger

168
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,750
you contain the experience without being defined by it

169
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,500
this simple practice creates a crucial gap

170
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
between you and your experience

171
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,958
the difference between being swept away by a river

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,083
and standing on the bank watching it flow

173
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,708
the bardos aren't just ancient philosophy

174
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,791
they're happening in your life right now

175
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,458
that moment between sleeping and waking

176
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,666
the transition between jobs or relationships

177
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,583
the space between one thought and the next

178
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:07,875
the Bardo Thödol

179
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,541
teaches that all states are temporary transitions

180
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,166
next time you're dealing with pain or difficulty

181
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,375
remind yourself

182
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:19,958
this too is a Bardo a temporary state that will pass

183
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,208
modern science has begun validating

184
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,416
many of the Bardothodol's core insights

185
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,916
in surprising ways

186
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,166
neuroscience research confirms what Tibetan Buddhists

187
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,916
understood centuries ago

188
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,708
consciousness exists in distinct

189
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,750
transitional states that we can learn to navigate

190
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,500
studies from the center for Healthy Minds

191
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,291
at the university of Wisconsin

192
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,875
have documented how long term meditators develop

193
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,125
measurable changes in brain function

194
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,416
precisely what the Bardo Thödol predicts

195
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,208
these practitioners can consciously enter and navigate

196
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,958
different states of consciousness

197
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,916
moving from beta to alpha to theta

198
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:05,500
brainwave states with remarkable control

199
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,791
Carl Jung was among the first western psychologists

200
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,625
to recognize the significance of this text

201
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,541
in 1935 he wrote a psychological commentary on it

202
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,583
seeing the peaceful and wrathful deities

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,250
described not as external gods

204
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,000
but as manifestations of our own mind

205
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,625
Jung didn't just theorize about these concepts

206
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,708
he applied them in therapy

207
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,541
helping patients navigate what he called

208
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,083
liminal spaces

209
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,375
between conscious and unconscious awareness

210
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,250
the latest research on psychedelic therapy

211
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,208
shows similar patterns temporary ego dissolution

212
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,375
revealing profound psychological insights

213
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,916
scientists like Roland Griffiths

214
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,291
at Johns Hopkins

215
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,208
have documented how psilocybin sessions

216
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,458
create experiences

217
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,250
remarkably similar to those described in the Bardo

218
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:01,291
Thödol

219
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,333
today's mindfulness movement

220
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,083
owes a tremendous debt to these Bardo teachings

221
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:11,208
when people use meditation apps or practice mindfulness

222
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,750
they're often using simplified versions

223
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,791
of the same awareness techniques

224
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,083
described in the Tibetan Book of the dead

225
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,958
observing thoughts and emotions

226
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,875
without being consumed by them

227
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,625
the essential process across all these modalities

228
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,916
is the same

229
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:30,291
recognizing the constructed nature of experience

230
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,541
and accessing a more fundamental awareness

231
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,541
that's the true power of these teachings

232
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,666
they work regardless of your belief system

233
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,708
the Thödol isn't asking you to adopt any specific

234
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:48,166
religious view it's describing the universal

235
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,375
architecture of consciousness itself

236
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,000
a map that works whether you're a Buddhist monk

237
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,500
a neuroscientist

238
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,583
or someone simply trying to navigate life's challenges

239
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,041
the Tibetan Book of the dead

240
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,000
didn't stay hidden in monasteries

241
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,416
it burst into western consciousness

242
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,666
and sparked a cultural revolution

243
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,333
in 1964 Timothy Leary

244
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,750
Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert published

245
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,916
The Psychedelic Experience

246
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,708
adapting the Bardo 

247
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,375
Thödol as a guide for psychedelic journeys

248
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,416
this book became the handbook for the 1960s

249
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,583
counterculture movement profoundly influencing

250
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,458
how people approached consciousness exploration

251
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,125
what's remarkable is how this ancient wisdom

252
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,000
found its way into popular music

253
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,958
John Lennon used lines

254
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,541
directly from "The Psychedelic Experience"

255
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:47,375
in the Beatles song "Tomorrow Never Knows,"

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,625
opening with lyrics inspired by the Bardo

257
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,541
Thodol's instructions for consciousness transition

258
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,625
this wasn't just artistic borrowing

259
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,000
it was an attempt to translate profound

260
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,625
spiritual insight into popular culture

261
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,291
the influence extended into film as well

262
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,333
Gaspar Noe's Enter the void

263
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,958
follows the consciousness of a character after death

264
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,250
using first person perspective

265
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,000
and hallucination sequences

266
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,041
that directly mirror the Bardo states

267
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,541
described in the Tibetan Book of the dead

268
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,083
even the Matrix

269
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,416
incorporates elements of these teachings

270
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Neo's journey can be interpreted as

271
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,958
moving through different levels of consciousness

272
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,000
with the red pill initiating his Bardo

273
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,125
like transition between perceived realities

274
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,000
in modern psychology and therapy

275
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,708
these concepts have found practical applications

276
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:47,291
Stanislav Grof's work in transpersonal psychology

277
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,791
draws heavily on Bardo concepts

278
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,708
using them to understand both ordinary and non

279
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,833
ordinary states of consciousness

280
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,708
Sogyal Rinpoche's modern interpretation

281
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,000
The Tibetan Book of living and dying

282
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,000
brought these teachings to mainstream

283
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,375
western audiences in the 1990s

284
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,500
it's sold over 3 million copies worldwide

285
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,833
and is used in palliative care settings

286
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,666
to help people approach death with greater awareness

287
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,958
few spiritual texts have had such profound impact

288
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,291
across so many dimensions of culture

289
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,708
but the most important question remains

290
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,791
how can this ancient wisdom transform

291
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,541
your own experience

292
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,083
we've explored the practical applications of the Bardo

293
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,916
Thödol but its deepest teaching addresses

294
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,666
humanity's greatest fear

295
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,541
death itself

296
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,375
the text offers a profound perspective shift

297
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,125
what if death isn't an ending but a transition

298
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,666
what if the awareness

299
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:54,083
witnessing your life continues beyond physical death

300
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,000
modern near death experience

301
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,208
research suggests consciousness may

302
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,500
indeed persist when brain activity ceases

303
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,125
paralleling what the Bardo

304
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,500
Thödol described centuries ago

305
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:05,958
but

306
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,000
even if you don't believe in literal afterlife states

307
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,458
the symbolic wisdom remains powerful

308
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,833
by confronting death directly

309
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,000
we dissolve the unconscious fear

310
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,250
driving much of our behavior

311
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,791
think about it how many decisions do you make from fear

312
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,000
rather than freedom

313
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,791
how often have you stayed in situations

314
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,750
that no longer serve you

315
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,416
because you were afraid of the alternative

316
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,875
the Bardo Thödol teaches that

317
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,750
by accepting impermanence fully

318
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,666
we paradoxically gain true freedom in life

319
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,208
throughout history

320
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,750
practitioners who deeply internalized these teachings

321
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,791
reported profound transformations

322
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,000
The 11th century Yogi Milarepa

323
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:51,125
described it as recognizing death as a doorway

324
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,833
rather than an end

325
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:57,083
completely liberating him from fear

326
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,500
so how do we actually use this wisdom

327
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,458
by regularly contemplating life's impermanence

328
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,416
not in a morbid way

329
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,083
but as a reminder of what truly matters

330
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,041
by recognizing that everything you experience

331
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,750
including your sense of self

332
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,291
is in constant transition

333
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,833
and here's the mind bending twist

334
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,125
that changes everything

335
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,541
by fully confronting and accepting

336
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,083
impermanence and death

337
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,458
we discover something that was there all along

338
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:30,541
an awareness that isn't born and doesn't die

339
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,916
when you stop identifying exclusively with your body

340
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,250
thoughts and emotions

341
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,541
you discover something much more vast and stable

342
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,750
beneath those changing appearances

343
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,291
you're not being dragged around by every thought

344
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,000
or emotion anymore

345
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,333
this recognition

346
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,708
doesn't just transform how you face death

347
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,916
it revolutionizes how you experience

348
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,791
every single moment of life

349
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,458
challenges that once seemed overwhelming

350
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,500
become workable

351
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,166
transitions that were terrifying become opportunities

352
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,291
even painful emotions

353
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,541
become doorways to deeper awareness

354
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,458
the Buddha himself

355
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,791
said that those who understand death are freed from it

356
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,291
the ultimate paradox of the Tibetan Book of the dead

357
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,875
is that by deeply accepting impermanence and death

358
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,291
we find the deathless awareness

359
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,833
that was our true nature all along

360
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,916
for the next seven days

361
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,708
I challenge you to practice the R E S T

362
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,666
method for just 5 minutes each morning

363
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,208
notice what arises in your experience

364
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,000
and move through the four steps

365
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,791
recognize what's happening

366
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,375
embrace without resistance

367
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,583
see through its temporary nature

368
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,500
transform your relationship to it

369
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,708
then throughout your day

370
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,000
watch for Bardo moments

371
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,041
those transitions between states

372
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,500
when you notice one pause briefly and apply the process

373
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,708
keep a small journal of your Bardo experiences

374
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,000
notice which states you got caught in

375
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,666
and which ones you navigated with awareness

376
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,833
appreciate your successes

377
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,958
and learn from the challenging moments

378
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,416
remember sleep itself is a Bardo state

379
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,958
as you drift off tonight

380
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,875
maintain a gentle awareness of the transition

381
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,125
from waking to dreaming consciousness

382
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,750
many practitioners report that this simple practice

383
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,833
transforms their sleep quality

384
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,875
and even leads to lucid dreaming

385
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,041
how do you know if these practices are working

386
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,041
look for these signs of progress

387
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,375
you'll notice thoughts and emotions arising

388
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,416
before they completely take over

389
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:44,000
you'll recover more quickly from challenging situations

390
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,291
you'll feel less overwhelmed by transitions and changes

391
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,041
you'll experience more moments of genuine peace

392
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,208
of course you'll face obstacles

393
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,041
the main one is simply forgetting to practice

394
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,708
that's why I recommend visible reminders

395
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,500
or partnering with a friend

396
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,666
another challenge is expecting instant results

397
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,125
remember Tibetan practitioners

398
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,416
spend years mastering these techniques

399
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,916
be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories

400
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,916
I'd love to hear about your experiences

401
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,375
in the comments below

402
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,125
what bardos are you currently navigating

403
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,000
which techniques have been most helpful

404
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,791
remember every challenge contains the seed of awakening

405
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,625
every transition

406
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,291
is an opportunity for greater awareness

407
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,041
and death itself

408
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,958
holds potential for profound liberation

409
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,791
thank you for joining me on this journey

410
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,291
through the Bardo Thödol

411
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,416
until next time stay curious and stay aware
