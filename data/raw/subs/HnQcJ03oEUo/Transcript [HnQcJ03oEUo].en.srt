2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,000
have you ever wished you could read

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,559
people's minds imagine the power of

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,519
knowing exactly what someone is thinking

5
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,760
well what if I told you that the Buddha

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,359
himself had techniques for doing just

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,760
that okay maybe not literally reading

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,480
minds but the Buddha did teach ways to

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,880
gain deep insight into the human mind

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,119
and behavior want to learn his secrets

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,720
I'm Matt and this is Buddha's wisdom

12
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,039
where ancient teachings meet modern

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,120
living

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,800
today we're going to explore a powerful

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,640
Buddhist tale about the Buddha's top

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,239
three techniques for understanding the

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,280
minds of others and our

18
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,160
own once upon a time in a small village

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,000
nestled at the foot of the Himalayas

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,079
there lived a young farmer named

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,280
Sanjay he was known throughout the

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,760
village for his diligence and his prized

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,440
possession a strong healthy Ox that

24
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,399
helped him plow his Fields One Day

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,079
sanj's neighbor Ravi came to him with a

26
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:02,480
request Sanjay my friend I hate to to

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,960
ask but my own Ox has fallen ill could I

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,000
please borrow yours for a few days to

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,680
plow my field I promis to return it

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
unharmed Sanji being a Kind and Generous

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,840
man agreed of course Ravi we're

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,479
neighbors after all just please take

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,960
good care of him Ravi greatfully took

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,000
the ox and set to work on his field but

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,560
after a few hours he noticed the ox

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,360
limping and refusing to pull the plow

37
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,799
worried Ravi returned the ox to Sanjay

38
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,840
immediately when Sanjay saw his beloved

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,600
Ox injured he was Furious he accused

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,479
Ravi of mistreating the animal and

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,320
demanded compensation for the Lost work

42
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:41,799
in Veterinary bills Ravi equally upset

43
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,240
denied any wrongdoing he insisted that

44
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,119
the ox must have already been hurt and

45
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,920
Sanjay was just looking for someone to

46
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,360
blame their argument grew heated drawing

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,159
the attention of the whole village each

48
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,640
Man became more entrenched in his own

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,840
perspective unable to see the situation

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,119
from the other's point of view just then

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,399
the Buddha was passing through the

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,799
village on his track travel s seeing the

53
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,880
commotion he approached the arguing men

54
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,679
with curiosity and compassion the Buddha

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,200
listened patiently observing the

56
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,160
situation with mindfulness he noticed

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,280
the anger and fear beneath sanj's

58
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,360
accusations and the defensiveness and

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,040
guilt behind ravi's denials with empathy

60
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,760
the Buddha imagined himself in each

61
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,519
man's position he felt sanj's

62
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,920
frustration at potentially losing his

63
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:29,519
livelihood and ravi's shame at being

64
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,360
accused of something he didn't do

65
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,879
finally

66
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,000
the Buddha spoke my friends I sense that

67
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:39,400
there is more to this story than meets

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,040
the eye Sanjay I can feel your worry

69
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,159
about providing for your family without

70
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,080
your ox and Ravi I can understand the

71
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,840
pain of being blamed for something

72
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,920
unfairly both men paused surprised at

73
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,720
the Buddha's Insight the Buddha

74
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,959
continued What If instead of arguing

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,560
about who is right and wrong we focused

76
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,400
on finding a solution that helps you

77
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,319
both sanj

78
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,319
what do you really need in this

79
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,319
situation Sanjay thought for a moment I

80
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,280
suppose I just need my Ox to be healthy

81
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:13,040
so I can work my land and feed my family

82
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,799
the Buddha nodded and turned to Ravi and

83
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,560
Ravi what do you truly want Ravi sighed

84
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:21,680
I don't want to be seen as a liar or a

85
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,239
thief I borrowed the ox in good faith

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,200
and returned it as soon as I noticed it

87
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,560
was

88
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,799
injured the Buddha smiled it seems to me

89
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,239
that you both want the same thing to be

90
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,400
seen as good honest men who are doing

91
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,200
your best to survive what if Ravi helps

92
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,599
Sanjay care for the ox until it heals

93
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,519
and in exchange Sanjay allows Ravi to

94
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:45,280
use the ox for his field once it

95
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,840
recovers that way you both get what you

96
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,159
need and no one is Accused

97
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,519
unfairly Sanjay and Ravi looked at each

98
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,159
other their anger slowly melting into

99
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,959
understanding they agreed to the

100
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,959
Buddha's suggestion and thanked him for

101
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,239
his wise

102
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,400
counsel as the Buddha continued on his

103
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,319
journey he reflected on the power of

104
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,879
mindfulness empathy and non-judgment to

105
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,519
transform conflicts and reveal the

106
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,400
Hidden Truths of the human heart by

107
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,599
simply being present and seeing Beyond

108
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,879
surface appearances he was able to guide

109
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,040
the two men from opposition to

110
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,919
cooperation and that my friends is the

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,680
essence of the Buddha's mind reading

112
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:23,360
techniques not some Supernatural power

113
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,160
but the profound ability to observe

114
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,120
without

115
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,320
judgment understand with compassion and

116
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,600
respond with

117
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,520
wisdom now let's look deeper at how the

118
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,880
Buddha used his mindreading techniques

119
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,360
of mindfulness empathy and non-judgment

120
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,320
to untangle this conflict when the

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,639
Buddha first approached Sanji and Ravi

122
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,240
he didn't immediately jump to

123
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,320
conclusions or take sides instead he

124
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,160
listened mindfully giving his full

125
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,479
attention to each man's words and the

126
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,400
emotions behind

127
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:54,759
them with Sanjay he noticed the anger

128
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,960
and accusation in his tone but also the

129
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:00,080
underlying fear Sanjay was worried about

130
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,880
his livelihood his ability to provide

131
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,960
for his loved ones his Ox was more than

132
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,080
just an animal to him it was his partner

133
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,680
in survival and with Ravi the Buddha

134
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,880
picked up on the defensiveness and the

135
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,759
hint of guilt Ravi truly believed he had

136
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,120
done nothing wrong but he also carried

137
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,840
the weight of being seen as a bad

138
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,759
neighbor a man whose word couldn't be

139
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,080
trusted the Buddha held these

140
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,759
observations without judgment he didn't

141
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,600
get caught up in deciding who was right

142
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:30,280
or wrong instead he looked deeper to the

143
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,600
root of the conflict too scared proud

144
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,520
men who both wanted to be seen as good

145
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,680
and

146
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,039
honorable with this understanding the

147
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,479
Buddha could tap into empathy he

148
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,560
imagined himself in each man's Place

149
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,560
feeling the sting of a threat to his

150
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,680
reputation the desperation of

151
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,720
potentially losing his source of income

152
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,759
he recognized that beneath the surface

153
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,960
these men were more alike than different

154
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,759
from this place of empathetic wisdom the

155
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,039
solution arose naturally to find a way

156
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,639
to meet both men's deeper needs by

157
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,560
suggesting that Ravi helped care for the

158
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,520
injured ox and then borrow it again once

159
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,160
it healed the buddha showed the men a

160
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,160
path where they could both get what they

161
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,520
wanted without shame or blame in the end

162
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,759
it was mindfulness that allowed the

163
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,199
Buddha to see clearly empathy that

164
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,240
allowed him to understand deeply and

165
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,199
nonjudgment that allowed him to craft a

166
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,160
wise and compassionate

167
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,919
solution we can all learn from the

168
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,960
Buddha's example in our own conflicts

169
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:29,880
and relationships we can practice

170
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,479
pausing and observing before reacting

171
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,120
we can ask ourselves what's really going

172
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,120
on beneath the surface here what is this

173
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,560
person feeling and needing and we can

174
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,759
challenge ourselves to let go of

175
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,960
simplistic judgments and instead embrace

176
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,960
the complex messy beautiful human

177
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,520
reality in front of

178
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,199
us I remember a time in my own life when

179
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,360
I was locked in a bitter argument with a

180
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,479
friend we were both so convinced that we

181
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,160
were right and the other was wrong it

182
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:00,000
felt like an impossible impass but then

183
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,800
I remembered the Buddha's teachings I

184
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,240
took a step back and just observed my

185
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,520
own feelings and thoughts without

186
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,360
judgment I tried to imagine what my

187
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,240
friend must be feeling too and suddenly

188
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,440
The Way Forward became clear I realized

189
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,800
