1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,279
Have you ever had the sneaking suspicion

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,920
that everything you thought was real

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,920
might just be an illusion? What if I

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,160
told you that your sense of self, the

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,560
objects you interact with, and even the

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,359
very nature of experience itself, are

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,039
all empty of inherent existence?

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,880
It sounds like the plot of a sci-fi

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,480
movie, but it's actually one of the most

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,960
profound insights of Buddhist

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,960
philosophy. Get ready to have your mind

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,359
blown as we explore the concept of

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,600
emptiness and how it can transform your

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,760
entire world view.

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,399
Hey there fellow wisdom seekers. It's

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,440
your favorite truth exploring buddy Matt

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,280
back with another mindexpanding video.

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,000
Today we're tackling one of the most

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,239
fascinating and challenging ideas in all

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,840
of Buddhism. Shunyata or emptiness. Now

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,320
before you start thinking this is some

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,399
bleak nihilistic philosophy, let me

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,879
assure you that emptiness is far from

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,600
meaningless. In fact, understanding

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,359
shunyata can be a liberating experience

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,560
that frees you from the mental traps

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,080
that keep you stuck in suffering.

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,680
Throughout the history of Buddhist

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,080
thought, there have been at least five

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,159
distinct meanings of emptiness. each one

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,159
building upon the last to create a

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,080
comprehensive view of reality that will

33
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,560
shatter your assumptions and open up new

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,640
possibilities for awakening.

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,200
In this video, we'll explore each of

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,880
these five aspects of Shunya in depth

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,560
using vivid examples and thought

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,119
experiments to help you grasp these

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,360
mindbending concepts. So, grab your

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,280
favorite beverage, settle in, and get

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,280
ready to have your reality turned upside

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,280
down.

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,320
Chapter 1. No subject.

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,799
Our journey begins with the teachings of

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,720
the Buddha himself. In the Sunny Suda,

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,960
he drops a bombshell on his unsuspecting

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,439
audience. The world, he says, is empty

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,799
of self and anything belonging to self.

49
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,799
Let that sink in for a moment.

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,560
The very sense of eye that we cling to

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,719
so tightly, that feels so solid and

52
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,560
real, is actually nowhere to be found in

53
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,479
our experience.

54
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,080
To illustrate this point, the Buddha

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,879
uses the analogy of a musical

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,280
performance. When you listen to music,

57
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,760
there's the musician, the instrument,

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,520
and the sound itself. These three

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,400
elements come together to create the

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,200
experience of music. But can you find a

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,480
separate independent self that's making

62
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,720
it all happen? Try as you might, you

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,280
won't be able to locate it. The music

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,519
arises from a complex web of causes and

65
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,000
conditions, not from some unchanging

66
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,640
essence. The same is true for our

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,720
experience of the world. When we examine

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,040
it closely, we find that there's no

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,680
solid permanent self at the center of it

70
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,760
all. Our thoughts, feelings, and

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,519
perceptions are constantly changing,

72
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,640
arising and passing away based on

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,959
various conditions. The self we cling to

74
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,360
so tightly is really just a convenient

75
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,319
fiction, a way of organizing experience

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,159
that has no ultimate reality. To further

77
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,720
illustrate this idea, let's use the

78
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,400
metaphor of a rainbow. When you see a

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,319
beautiful rainbow stretching across the

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,640
sky, it appears to be a solid

81
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,400
independent thing. But when you try to

82
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,319
locate the rainbow, you'll find that

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,560
it's not actually there in any fixed

84
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,640
permanent sense. It's an appearance that

85
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,720
arises due to specific causes and

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,400
conditions like sunlight, water

87
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,120
droplets, and the position of the

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,480
observer. The rainbow is empty of

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,319
inherent existence, just like the self.

90
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,599
Another example is the character in a

91
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,959
dream. When you're dreaming, the you in

92
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,519
the dream appears to be real and solid.

93
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,519
But upon waking, you realize that this

94
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,000
dream self was just a temporary

95
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,280
appearance, a product of your sleeping

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,599
mind.

97
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,920
In the same way, our waking sense of

98
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,080
self is a kind of dream, an appearance

99
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,720
that arises due to various causes and

100
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,200
conditions, but lacks any ultimate

101
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,120
independent reality.

102
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,599
This might sound unsettling at first,

103
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,120
but it's actually a liberating insight.

104
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,439
When we start to see through the

105
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,840
illusion of a separate self, we can let

106
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,640
go of a lot of the anxiety, attachment,

107
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,959
and aversion that comes with it. we can

108
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,160
start to experience life in a more open,

109
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,919
fluid, and compassionate way.

110
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,759
Chapter 2, no object.

111
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,160
But the Buddha's teachings on emptiness

112
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,320
don't stop at the self.

113
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,160
The great Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna

114
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,680
takes things a step further, pointing

115
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,360
out that even the objects of our

116
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,240
experience are empty of inherent

117
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,560
existence. Let's use this very video as

118
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,240
an example. As you watch it, you might

119
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,639
assume that you're perceiving a distinct

120
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,040
independent thing called this video. But

121
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,720
if we start to examine it more closely,

122
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,440
we'll see that it's actually a complex

123
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,360
web of interconnected phenomena.

124
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,600
There's the script I'm reading from, the

125
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,360
pixels on your screen, the sound waves

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,000
coming out of your speakers, the

127
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,160
concepts and ideas being conveyed, the

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,639
platform it's hosted on, the device

129
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,320
you're watching it on, and even the vast

130
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,320
network of causes and conditions that

131
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,479
led to its creation, like the invention

132
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,720
of language, the development of digital

133
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,199
technology, and the entire history of

134
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,039
human culture. When we really dig into

135
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,280
it, we find that there's no solid

136
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,240
independent thing called this video that

137
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,039
exists apart from everything else. It's

138
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,960
all a fluid, everchanging process, a

139
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,759
dance of interdependent elements that we

140
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,840
label and conceptualize for convenience.

141
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,160
The same is true for any object of our

142
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,759
experience, from the simplest sensation

143
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,360
to the most complex abstract idea. To

144
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,680
understand this emptiness of objects

145
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,000
more concretely, think of a delicious

146
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,160
meal at a restaurant. When you're eating

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,759
the meal, it appears to be a distinct

148
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,919
independent thing. The pasta, the sauce,

149
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,080
the flavors all seem to exist in and of

150
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,000
themselves. But if you start to look

151
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,680
more closely, you'll see that the meal

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,759
is actually a complex web of

153
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,120
interconnected phenomena. The

154
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,280
ingredients that were grown and

155
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,440
harvested, the chef who prepared the

156
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,680
dish, the cultural traditions that

157
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,759
shaped the recipe, the economic systems

158
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,199
that allowed the restaurant to exist,

159
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,520
and so on. The meal, like any object, is

160
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,520
empty of inherent existence, dependent

161
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,759
on an infinite network of causes and

162
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,840
conditions.

163
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,600
This might sound a bit abstract, but it

164
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,160
has profound implications for how we

165
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,400
relate to the world. When we start to

166
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,400
see the emptiness of things, we can let

167
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,759
go of a lot of the grasping and aversion

168
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,800
that comes from taking them too

169
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,560
seriously. We can appreciate the fluid,

170
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,319
interconnected nature of reality and

171
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,100
find a sense of ease and freedom in the

172
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,800
midst of constant change.

173
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:44,479
[Music]

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,319
Chapter 3. No subject and object. So

175
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,840
far, we've seen how both the subject and

176
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,479
object of experience are empty of

177
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,639
inherent existence. But the Yoga School

178
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,240
of Buddhism takes things even further,

179
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,800
pointing out that the very distinction

180
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,319
between subject and object is itself an

181
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,000
illusion.

182
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,479
Think about the experience of perceiving

183
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,880
the color red. In our ordinary way of

184
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,840
thinking, there's a separate you who is

185
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,000
seeing an independent redness out there.

186
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,680
But the yoga argue that this dualistic

187
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,240
way of framing experience is

188
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,800
fundamentally mistaken.

189
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,479
In reality, the redness and the seeing

190
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,039
of redness are completely

191
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,240
interdependent, arising together as a

192
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,720
single seamless experience. It's like

193
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,319
two sides of the same coin. You can't

194
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,720
have a coin with only heads or only

195
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,360
tails. The two sides depend on each

196
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,520
other for their very existence. In the

197
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,759
same way, you can't have a perceiver

198
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,759
without something perceived or an object

199
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,240
of perception without a perceiving

200
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,639
consciousness. The two are mutually

201
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,520
dependent, arising together in a single

202
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,360
indivisible moment of experience. To

203
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,360
illustrate this nonduality of subject

204
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,840
and object, imagine you're walking in a

205
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,000
beautiful forest. In the traditional way

206
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,080
of thinking, there's a separate you who

207
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,479
is experiencing the forest as a separate

208
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,720
object. But in the moment of direct

209
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,160
experience, is there really a separation

210
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,400
between you and the forest? The colors,

211
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,639
sounds, and smells of the forest are

212
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,720
arising in your consciousness, and your

213
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,000
consciousness is taking the shape of the

214
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,240
forest. The two are interpenetrating and

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,199
defining each other, like a dance in

216
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,039
which the dancer and the dance are one.

217
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,000
Or think of the experience of falling in

218
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,759
love. When you're in love, the

219
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,160
traditional boundaries between self and

220
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,000
others seem to dissolve. You feel a

221
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,240
sense of union and intimacy with your

222
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,039
beloved, as if your two hearts and minds

223
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,440
were merging into one. This is a taste

224
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,120
of the non-dual nature of experience in

225
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,360
which the rigid separation between

226
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,519
subject and object softens and yields to

227
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,480
a more fluid interconnected way of

228
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,120
being. This non-dual view of experience

229
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,560
has some mindbending implications. It

230
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,560
means that the fundamental nature of

231
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,279
reality is not some collection of

232
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,440
separate independent things but rather a

233
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,360
fluid seamless hole in which all the

234
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,240
elements interpenetrate and define each

235
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,399
other. So when we talk about emptiness

236
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,320
in the context of Buddha nature we're

237
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,360
pointing to the inherent freedom and

238
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,080
wholeness of our true being.

239
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,480
We're not separate isolated entities but

240
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,480
rather expressions of the vast open

241
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,240
awareness that is the very nature of

242
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,080
reality itself.

243
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,480
And just as the images on a movie screen

244
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,880
are temporary appearances that arise and

245
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,839
pass away, our sense of being a separate

246
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,440
self is also a kind of projection, a

247
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,040
convincing illusion created by the mind.

248
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,720
When we start to see through this

249
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,120
illusion and touch the luminous

250
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,680
awareness that we truly are, we discover

251
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,240
a profound sense of liberation and inner

252
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,480
peace. This isn't something that we need

253
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,640
to achieve or create. It's the very

254
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,440
nature of what we are beneath the layers

255
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,200
of confusion and conditioning.

256
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,600
And by learning to rest in this pure

257
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,200
awareness, we gradually dissolve the

258
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,200
false sense of separation between

259
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,519
ourselves and the world and awaken to

260
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,160
the unity and interdependence of all

261
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,080
things. Of course, this doesn't mean

262
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,519
that we bypass or ignore the challenges

263
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,200
and complexities of life. Rather, it

264
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,760
means that we meet them from a place of

265
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,440
greater wisdom, openness, and

266
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,519
compassion.

267
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,279
We still engage fully with the world,

268
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,440
but we do so with a sense of lightness

269
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,440
and flexibility, knowing that all

270
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,959
experiences are fleeting expressions of

271
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,959
the endlessly creative dance of

272
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,959
awareness.

273
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,320
Chapter 5. No views. Now, just when you

274
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,279
thought you had a handle on emptiness,

275
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,279
Buddhism throws one final curveball. The

276
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,360
idea that all views, even the most

277
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,720
profound spiritual insights, are

278
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,640
themselves empty of inherent existence.

279
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,880
This is the radical claim of the

280
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,800
emptiness of views teachings which

281
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,880
suggests that any conceptual framework

282
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,519
or belief system we use to understand

283
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,720
reality is ultimately just a provisional

284
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,800
tool not the final truth. Even the

285
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,120
Buddha's own teachings as profound and

286
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,839
transformative as they may be are empty

287
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,519
of inherent existence mere fingers

288
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,120
pointing at the moon of ultimate

289
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,279
reality.

290
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,360
The danger of getting attached to views,

291
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,480
even Buddhist ones, is that it can lead

292
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,640
to dogmatism, closed-mindedness, and a

293
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,640
kind of spiritual materialism where we

294
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,360
use our beliefs to bolster the ego

295
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,680
rather than dissolve it. We might start

296
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,160
to identify with being a Buddhist or a

297
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,560
meditator and use that identity to feel

298
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,800
superior to others or avoid the messy

299
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,279
unpredictable reality of life as it

300
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,519
actually is. To illustrate the emptiness

301
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,839
of views, consider again the metaphor of

302
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,920
the movie screen. The teachings and

303
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,760
concepts we use to understand reality

304
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,160
are like the images projected onto the

305
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,480
screen. They can be informative,

306
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,040
inspiring, or thoughtprovoking, but they

307
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,839
are not the screen itself. They are

308
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,760
temporary appearances, useful tools for

309
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,880
guiding us towards a direct experience

310
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,720
of the ultimate nature of reality. Just

311
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,200
as we wouldn't confuse a map for the

312
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,120
actual territory it represents, we must

313
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,160
be careful not to mistake our views and

314
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,399
beliefs for reality itself, even the

315
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,800
most sublime spiritual teachings are

316
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,800
ultimately empty of inherent existence,

317
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,880
mere fingers pointing at the moon of

318
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,720
truth. This might sound a bit

319
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,240
disorienting at first, as if we're

320
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,800
pulling the rug out from under all our

321
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,959
cherished beliefs and assumptions. But

322
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,200
the emptiness of views is actually a

323
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,360
profoundly liberating teaching, one that

324
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,320
frees us from the tyranny of dogma and

325
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,480
fixed ideas. When we recognize that all

326
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,279
views are empty, we can engage with them

327
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,519
more playfully and flexibly, using them

328
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,399
as tools for awakening rather than as

329
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,399
fixed positions to defend.

330
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,160
We can appreciate the relative truth of

331
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,720
different perspectives without getting

332
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,800
trapped in any one of them. and we can

333
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,200
rest more easily in the groundlessness

334
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,800
of our own being, trusting the inherent

335
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,079
wisdom and compassion of our Buddha

336
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,040
nature to guide us through the

337
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,880
complexities of life. Ultimately, the

338
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,720
emptiness of views points us back to the

339
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,519
simplicity and immediiacy of our own

340
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,360
direct experience. It invites us to let

341
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,680
go of our reliance on conceptual

342
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,079
frameworks and trust the intelligence of

343
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,240
the present moment. And it reminds us

344
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,399
that the ultimate truth is always right

345
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,040
here in the midst of the everanging

346
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:23,720
dance of appearances, waiting for us to

347
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,720
recognize it as our own true nature.

348
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,639
We've covered a lot of ground in this

349
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,120
video, exploring the five main aspects

350
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,920
of emptiness in Buddhism. The lack of an

351
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,560
inherent self, the emptiness of objects,

352
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,480
the nonduality of subject and object,

353
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,880
the Buddha nature within us, and the

354
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,560
emptiness of all views.

355
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,200
It's a lot to take in and it can be

356
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,880
pretty mind-bending at first, but I hope

357
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,399
this exploration has given you a taste

358
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,480
of the profound implications of

359
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,440
emptiness for our understanding of

360
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,519
ourselves and the world. Emptiness isn't

361
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,959
about nihilism or meaninglessness. It's

362
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,040
about seeing through our limited,

363
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,959
conditioned ways of perceiving reality

364
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,959
and awakening to the fluid,

365
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,839
interconnected, and ultimately

366
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,279
inconceivable nature of things. It's a

367
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,320
teaching that can transform our

368
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,720
relationship to ourselves, others, and

369
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,399
the world, opening up new possibilities

370
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,720
for wisdom, compassion, and freedom. But

371
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,480
don't take my word for it. The real

372
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,959
power of these teachings lies in

373
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,920
exploring them for yourself in your own

374
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,600
direct experience. The Buddha himself

375
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,760
encouraged us to be lamps unto

376
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,360
ourselves, to test out the teachings and

377
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,079
see if they hold up in the laboratory of

378
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,399
our own lives. So, I invite you to take

379
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:39,040
these ideas and run with them, to play

380
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,320
with them in your own experience and see

381
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,079
what new insights and awakenings emerge.

382
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,079
As we navigate the ups and downs of

383
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,160
life, we can use these teachings as a

384
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,839
kind of compass, guiding us back to the

385
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,000
spaciousness and clarity of our true

386
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,760
nature. When we get caught up in the

387
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,160
solidity and drama of our thoughts and

388
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,800
emotions, we can remember the rainbow

389
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,760
and the clouds and let them dissolve

390
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,240
into the open sky of awareness. When we

391
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,480
feel isolated and disconnected, we can

392
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,320
remember the pasta and the music and

393
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,880
feel our deep interbeing with all

394
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,880
things. And when we get attached to our

395
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,040
ideas and opinions, we can remember the

396
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,920
movie screen and the projector and hold

397
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,600
our views more lightly. Ultimately, the

398
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,760
teachings on emptiness are an invitation

399
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,399
to let go of our limited conditioned

400
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,959
ways of seeing and being and to relax

401
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,760
into the vast, open, and luminous nature

402
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,680
of reality itself. It's a journey of

403
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,000
discovery and awakening that we're all

404
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,440
on together. A dance of wisdom and

405
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,320
compassion that has no beginning or end.

406
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,000
So keep exploring, keep questioning, and

407
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,279
keep opening to the incredible mystery

408
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,320
and beauty of this life. And remember,

409
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,920
the truth you seek is always right here,

410
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,600
shining in the heart of your own

411
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,759
awareness.

412
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,920
It's not something distant or abstract,

413
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,600
but the very ground of your being, the

414
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,920
source and substance of all that you

415
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,480
experience. If this journey into the

416
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,800
heart of emptiness has inspired you, I

417
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,040
invite you to like this video, subscribe

418
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,720
to our channel, and share this teaching

419
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,120
with anyone who might be ready for a

420
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,040
radical shift in perspective.

421
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,800
Thank you for joining me on this wild

422
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,199
and wonderful ride through the world of

423
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,519
Shunyata. May these teachings be of

424
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,600
benefit to you and all beings. And may

425
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,160
they help us to awaken to the clear,

426
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,800
boundless, and radiant nature of our own

427
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,320
true being. And remember, whatever you

428
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,560
do, don't mistake the finger for the

429
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,720
moon. Keep looking beyond the concepts

430
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,680
and beliefs and trust the innate wisdom

431
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,680
of your own awakened heart.

432
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,350
Until next time, my friends, may you

433
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:48,509
rest in the vast open space of yours.

434
