00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,125
hey guys

2
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,458
Matt here from Buddha's wisdom

3
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:15,791
and today

4
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:17,583
I'm going to share something that blew my mind

5
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,041
when I first discovered it

6
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:24,791
in 1700 Japan a samurai named Yamamoto Tsunetomo

7
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,125
wrote something that changed history forever

8
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,458
after decades of serving as

9
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:31,416
one of Japan's deadliest warriors

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,333
he revealed that true power comes not from the sword

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,416
but from Buddhist wisdom but don't click away

12
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,416
this isn't just another history lesson

13
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:40,958
this is the true story

14
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,791
of how Japan's most feared warriors

15
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,666
discovered something incredible

16
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,500
the path to becoming unstoppable

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,958
wasn't through more fighting

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,125
it was through meditation and inner peace

19
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:52,583
and get this

20
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:56,500
what these legendary warriors discovered centuries ago

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,458
is so powerful the modern Special Forces

22
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,125
Olympic athletes

23
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,166
and some of the world's top performers

24
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,750
still use these exact same techniques today

25
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,500
in this video you'll discover

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,291
how Buddhist wisdom

27
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,458
transformed Japan's deadliest fighters

28
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,416
into something far more powerful

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,708
we'll explore the 7 virtues

30
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:21,500
that turned ordinary warriors into legends

31
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,916
the secret training methods that modern

32
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,500
elite forces still use

33
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,583
and the mind blowing way these warriors found

34
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:31,375
ultimate power through inner peace

35
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:37,166
but first we need to go back to where it all began

36
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,916
to a time when Japan was torn by war

37
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,958
and warriors were about to discover something

38
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,416
that would change them forever

39
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,083
we need to go back to the year 1191

40
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,500
when something incredible happened in Japan

41
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:57,250
a Buddhist monk named Eisai returned from China

42
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,333
but this wasn't just any monk

43
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,000
Eisai was a Maverick a rebel

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,916
who had traveled across dangerous seas to China twice

45
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,250
searching for the deepest teachings of Buddhism

46
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,416
in China Eisai discovered something different

47
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,208
from the complex

48
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,958
Buddhist teachings that already existed

49
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:13,750
in Japan

50
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,416
he found Zen a direct

51
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,333
practical powerful way to train the mind

52
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,583
he knew this could change everything

53
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,125
you see Japan was in chaos

54
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,458
the old imperial system was breaking down

55
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,500
and a new warrior class called the samurai

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,708
was rising to power

57
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,416
these samurai were the deadliest fighters

58
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,083
Japan had ever seen but

59
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,750
they were searching for something more than just

60
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,791
physical strength

61
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,125
here's where it gets interesting

62
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,666
when Eisai brought Zen to Japan

63
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,208
he didn't go to the peaceful temples of Kyoto

64
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,708
instead

65
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,541
he headed straight to Kamakura

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,500
the warrior capital

67
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,791
because he saw something nobody else did

68
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,291
he recognized that

69
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,958
these warriors needed more than just combat training

70
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,416
they needed a way to master their minds

71
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,041
this brings us to Kenchō-ji

72
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:07,000
now this wasn't just another temple

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,041
Kenchō-ji was the first Zen training monastery

74
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,166
ever built in Japan founded in 1253

75
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,958
by the most powerful warrior family of the time

76
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,375
the Hōjō clan

77
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,041
picture this

78
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:23,083
a massive temple complex built into the mountains

79
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,208
where warriors and monks trained side by side

80
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,333
think about how revolutionary this was

81
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,125
in one part of Kenchō-ji

82
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,875
you'd have monks sitting in complete silence

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,708
while in another samurai practiced sword techniques

84
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,750
but something remarkable happened when these two worlds

85
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,000
collided the warriors began to realize that the monks

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,791
mental training

87
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,041
could make them more effective in battle

88
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,250
the records from Kenchō-ji tell us something fascinating

89
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:55,041
these samurai discovered that through Zen practice

90
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,875
they could maintain absolute clarity and chaos

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,750
make split second decisions without hesitation

92
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,750
and develop an awareness

93
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,708
that seemed almost supernatural

94
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,208
these aren't just stories passed down

95
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,166
we have actual written records

96
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,291
The Azuma Kagami

97
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,250
a detailed historical chronicle from that period

98
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,000
documents how the Hōjō rulers

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,041
actively supported this fusion of Zen

100
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,750
and warrior culture

101
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,250
pretty cool

102
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,541
when history backs up these incredible tales

103
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:28,041
this combination of warrior skills and Buddhist wisdom

104
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,208
created something entirely new

105
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,333
something that would change Japanese culture forever

106
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,916
and lead to the development of a remarkable code

107
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,583
that we still study today

108
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,875
want to know what these warriors discovered?

109
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,041
let's explore

110
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,250
the 7 incredible virtues that became known as Bushido

111
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,000
the way of the warrior

112
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:55,791
so what exactly

113
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,791
was this code that emerged from the fusion of Zen

114
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,750
wisdom and warrior culture

115
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,083
the samurai called it Bushido

116
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,625
the way of the warrior

117
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,958
and at its heart were seven virtues

118
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,250
that transformed these fighters

119
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,041
into something far more powerful

120
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,791
the first virtue is righteousness or Gi

121
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,791
Imagine being so committed to doing what's right

122
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,916
that you'd give up everything to protect it

123
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,833
that's exactly what happened in 1701

124
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,125
when 47 samurai sacrificed their entire lives

125
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,000
to rightfully avenge their master

126
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,750
knowing they'd be sentenced to death for it that's Gi

127
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,916
I know what you're thinking Matt

128
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:35,541
are you telling me

129
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,083
these super serious warriors were basically ancient

130
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,416
Buddhist life coaches?

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,791
well

132
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,083
kind of

133
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:42,916
but

134
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,833
instead of posting inspirational quotes on Instagram

135
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,500
they were living these principles

136
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,958
with a sword at their side

137
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,125
then we have courage Yu

138
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,458
but this isn't about being fearless

139
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,916
the samurai new real

140
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,000
courage is about facing your fears and acting anyway

141
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,541
historical records tell us of warriors

142
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,250
who would meditate before battle

143
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,458
not to eliminate fear

144
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,833
but to act with clarity despite it

145
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,125
benevolence Jin

146
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,291
now this one might surprise you

147
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,083
these deadly warriors were expected to show compassion

148
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:20,916
and mercy

149
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,291
we have documented cases of samurai

150
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,625
protecting entire villages during wars

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,083
even when it went against their lord's orders

152
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,000
because jin meant using your power to help others

153
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,375
respect Rei

154
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,583
this wasn't just about bowing and being polite

155
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,208
it went much deeper

156
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,041
there are records of samurai

157
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,708
treating their enemies with honor

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,250
even in death

159
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,083
because they understood

160
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:52,375
the true power comes with deep respect for all life

161
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
honesty Makoto

162
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,708
the samurai believed that lying poisoned your spirit

163
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,583
real records from clan meetings

164
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,833
show how warriors would admit their mistakes

165
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,416
even when it meant severe punishment

166
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,500
because truth was more important than consequences

167
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,166
honor Meiyo

168
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,583
your reputation was everything

169
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,500
but not in the way you might think

170
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,458
it wasn't about fame

171
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,958
it was about being the same person in private

172
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,500
that you were in public living with complete integrity

173
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,500
no matter who was watching

174
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,500
and finally loyalty

175
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:35,875
Chugi

176
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,500
but here's the fascinating part

177
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,250
the samurai combined this with Buddhist wisdom

178
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,833
true loyalty wasn't blind obedience

179
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,833
it was about being loyal to your principles first

180
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,208
to what you knew was right

181
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,000
but these virtues weren't just philosophical ideas

182
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,666
written in ancient texts they were practical tools

183
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,416
that transformed every aspect of a warrior's life

184
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,416
and that's where our story gets even more interesting

185
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,291
Wanna know how they actually trained in these virtues?

186
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,000
how they turned these principles into real power?

187
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,541
let's look at the incredible ways they trained

188
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,166
both body and mind

189
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,750
now let me show you how these warriors actually trained

190
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,083
because what they did

191
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,458
was unlike anything the world had seen before

192
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,875
they didn't just practice sword techniques

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,750
they completely rewired their minds and bodies

194
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,958
let's look at something fascinating

195
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,375
from Yagyu Munenori's Secret Manual written in 1632

196
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:43,125
he was the sword instructor to three Japanese shoguns

197
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,291
and he wrote something incredible

198
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,708
the highest level of sword mastery

199
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,916
isn't about sword techniques

200
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:52,458
at all it's about achieving what they called no mind

201
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,541
but what exactly is no mind

202
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,541
imagine being so present so focused

203
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,625
that your body moves

204
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,375
before your thoughts get in the way

205
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,208
the samurai would spend hours in meditation

206
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,333
then immediately pick up their swords

207
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,708
they discovered that an empty mind made their reactions

208
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,791
lightning fast

209
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,125
picture trying to explain to your friends

210
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,583
that your new workout routine

211
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,625
involves sitting completely still

212
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,166
and emptying your mind

213
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,958
they probably think you're just being lazy

214
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,041
but these warriors knew better

215
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,875
it's actually harder than doing 1,000 pushups

216
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,333
trust me I tried both

217
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,583
here's a mind blowing training method they used

218
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,000
a warrior would sit in meditation in a temple

219
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,375
completely still

220
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,666
while behind him another samurai would wait

221
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,833
ready to strike with a wooden sword

222
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,541
the warrior wasn't allowed to move

223
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,916
until the exact moment of attack

224
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,833
this trained them to act from pure awareness

225
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,416
without thinking

226
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,875
and we have records of another incredible practice

227
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,333
samurai would spend hours performing the same sword cut

228
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,708
thousands of times but here's the key

229
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,208
they weren't just practicing the movement

230
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,000
they were learning to empty their minds

231
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,791
through the action making each cut

232
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,500
as if it were the only one that mattered

233
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,333
in the dojo they had the saying

234
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,250
think about that

235
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,791
these warriors figured out that the real battle

236
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,916
wasn't with the enemy it was with their own thoughts

237
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,875
their own fears their own doubts

238
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,833
the craziest part

239
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,916
modern science

240
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,833
is just now proving how effective these methods were

241
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,833
studies show that this combination of meditation

242
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,500
and movement literally rewires your brain

243
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,666
making you calmer under pressure

244
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:43,500
sharper in your decisions and faster in your reactions

245
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,916
and here's something wild

246
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,416
these exact same techniques are being used today

247
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:50,375
Navy

248
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,625
Seals practice meditation before high stakes missions

249
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,000
just like those ancient warriors

250
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,166
Olympic athletes

251
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,041
use these focusing methods to stay calm

252
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,208
under pressure even Silicon Valley

253
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,916
CEOs are taking up sword practice and meditation

254
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,708
talk about history repeating itself right

255
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:08,541
but

256
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,000
the real test of all this training wasn't in the dojo

257
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,500
it was on the battlefield

258
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,583
and what happened when these warrior monks

259
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,041
put their training to the test

260
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,625
well that's a whole other story

261
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:21,958
ready to see

262
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,208
how this training played out in real combat?

263
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:25,791
because the

264
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,500
historical accounts of what these warriors could do

265
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,125
are absolutely incredible

266
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,375
let me take us from their training methods to real

267
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,083
historical examples of how they use these skills

268
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,375
so what happened when these warrior monks

269
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,875
put their training to the test

270
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,875
the historical records tell us

271
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,291
some absolutely incredible stories

272
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,208
take the famous battle of Sekigahara in 1600

273
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,875
we have documented accounts of samurai

274
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,125
who used their Zen training

275
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,791
in the middle of Japan's biggest and bloodiest battle

276
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,375
in their writings

277
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,791
they describe entering a state of total clarity

278
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,583
even as chaos erupted all around them

279
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,416
these warriors could sense exactly when to move

280
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:17,500
when to strike and most importantly when to stay still

281
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,875
but here's an even more amazing example

282
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,958
in 1582

283
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:29,125
a samurai named Tadaoki Hosokawa faced an entire army

284
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,916
with just a handful of men

285
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,500
the odds were impossible but instead of panicking

286
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,291
historical records tell us

287
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,500
he sat in meditation before the battle

288
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,833
when he opened his eyes

289
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,583
he led his men with such calm precision

290
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,708
that they held their position for three crucial hours

291
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,166
saving thousands of lives

292
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,791
and it wasn't just in battle

293
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
we have records from the Tokugawa period

294
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,583
of samurai

295
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,083
using their Zen training in real sword duels

296
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,708
they describe something fascinating

297
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,166
the ability to read their opponent's intention

298
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,583
before they even moved

299
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,083
one account tells of a master

300
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,166
who won a duel without drawing his sword

301
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,750
he sensed his opponent's attack coming

302
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,166
and simply wasn't there when the strike came

303
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,000
but perhaps the most powerful example

304
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,291
comes from the writings of Miyamoto Musashi

305
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,916
Japan's most famous sword saint

306
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,291
he won over 60 duels and in his book

307
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,791
The Book of Five Rings he tells us his secret

308
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:34,083
the mind must be free like the surface of still water

309
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,750
he wasn't talking about fighting technique

310
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,833
he was describing the Zen state

311
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,791
he achieved through years of training

312
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:41,416
but

313
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,958
it wasn't just warriors who mastered these principles

314
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,375
there's this amazing story about a Zen master

315
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:51,500
named Hakuin when falsely accused of fathering a child

316
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,958
he simply said is that so

317
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,541
and took care of the baby for a year

318
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,500
when the truth finally came out

319
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,375
he returned the child with the same calm response

320
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,166
now that's what you call keeping your cool

321
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,833
the samurai weren't the only ones who could stay calm

322
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:08,708
under pressure

323
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,208
these weren't just isolated incidents

324
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,458
all across Japan

325
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,291
warriors who combined Zen practice with martial arts

326
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,500
were doing things that seemed impossible

327
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,375
moving with perfect timing

328
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,541
making decisions in split seconds

329
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,500
remaining totally calm in the face of death

330
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,958
but here's what's really interesting

331
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,041
the real power of their training showed up

332
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,750
and how they lived not just how they fought

333
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,500
and that brings us to our final chapter

334
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,291
about how these warrior monks

335
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,625
applied their wisdom to everyday life

336
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,791
wanna know how they turn these battlefield insights

337
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,791
into principles for daily living?

338
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,333
because this might be the most valuable lesson of all

339
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,041
let me show you why these ancient warrior monks

340
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,875
teachings became so powerful

341
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:03,666
in 1700 Yamamoto Tsunetomo wrote something fascinating

342
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,750
the way of the samurai is found in death

343
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,041
now that sounds pretty dark

344
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,833
but what he really meant was revolutionary

345
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,916
by accepting death

346
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,458
these warriors learn to live more fully

347
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,833
more authentically calm than ever before

348
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,250
let me give you a real example

349
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,833
from the historical records

350
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,125
every morning samurai would wake before dawn

351
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,583
they would begin their day with meditation

352
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,500
followed by weapons practice

353
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,125
but here's the interesting part

354
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,000
before any training

355
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,750
they would spend time contemplating their own death

356
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,291
not in a morbid way

357
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,458
but as a reminder to live this day with purpose

358
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,291
their daily routines were incredible

359
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,750
we have detailed records from samurai households

360
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,500
they would alternate between intense training

361
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
and periods of peaceful arts

362
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,000
from sword practice to calligraphy

363
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,416
from meditation to poetry

364
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,916
they understood something profound

365
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,416
true strength comes from balance

366
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,791
but it went even deeper than that

367
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:08,833
these warriors

368
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,250
applied the seven virtues to everything they did

369
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,708
when they prepared tea they did it with the same focus

370
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,333
they brought to sword fighting

371
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,500
when they arranged flowers

372
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,000
they approached it with the same discipline

373
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,208
as military strategy even

374
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,750
their everyday conversations

375
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,916
were guided by principles of respect

376
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,041
and honesty

377
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,833
and here's the mind blowing part

378
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,291
we found scrolls

379
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,500
describing how some samurai would spend hours

380
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,000
just arranging their armor

381
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:39,750
not out of vanity but as a meditation practice

382
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,083
every action no matter how small

383
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,583
was a chance to train their minds

384
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,208
think about it

385
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,833
these warriors figured out something incredible

386
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,416
the same principles that kept them alive in battle

387
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,083
made their everyday lives extraordinary

388
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,500
the focus that helped them face death

389
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,958
help them live more fully

390
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,375
and get this these warrior monks influenced

391
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,125
spread way beyond the battlefield

392
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,041
their

393
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,125
Zen practices transform Japanese culture itself

394
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,750
from the precise movements of the tea ceremony

395
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,375
to the minimalist beauty of rock gardens

396
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,625
even today's Japanese architecture and design

397
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,958
it all carries traces of this warrior monk wisdom

398
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,750
who knew the deadliest fighters in Japan

399
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,291
would end up influencing art more than war

400
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:31,291
and that that brings us to something even more amazing

401
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,166
because what these warrior monks discovered

402
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,416
centuries ago

403
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,541
is still changing lives today

404
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,750
these ancient warrior monks

405
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,416
discovered something timeless

406
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,541
something that's just as powerful today

407
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,166
as it was centuries ago

408
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,958
the ultimate strength isn't in your sword

409
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,041
or even in your skills it's in your mind

410
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,708
think about it we just witnessed

411
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,625
how deadly warriors

412
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,875
transformed into enlightened masters

413
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,500
how the same principles that made them unstoppable

414
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,416
in battle help them find inner peace

415
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,958
and here's the amazing thing

416
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,500
you can use these exact same principles in your life

417
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,291
today whether you're facing challenges at work

418
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,166
dealing with stress or just

419
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,541
trying to become a stronger version of yourself

420
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,875
the wisdom of these warrior monks shows us the way

421
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,208
their seven virtues their training methods

422
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,333
their daily practices

423
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,458
they all point to one simple truth

424
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,208
real power starts from within

425
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,625
and just like those ancient warriors

426
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,583
