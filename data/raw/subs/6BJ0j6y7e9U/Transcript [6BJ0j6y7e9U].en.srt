1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,080
imagine a religion that challenges the

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,639
very idea of

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,599
God a tradition that says the path to

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,560
Enlightenment lies not in divine

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,680
intervention but in our own hearts and

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,960
Minds well buckle up because that's

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,000
exactly what Buddhism proposes and it

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,160
sparked some serious controversy over

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,199
the centuries what's up wisdom Seekers

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,039
Matt here and today we're embarking on a

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,800
journey to the heart of one of the most

12
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,550
provocative questions in spiritual

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,160
history why don't Buddhists believe in

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,039
[Music]

15
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,680
God now before we dive in let me be

16
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,399
clear this video isn't about pushing any

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,360
agenda or disrespecting anyone's beliefs

18
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,920
Buddhism is all about free inquiry and

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,399
questioning everything even its own

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,920
teachings so whether you're a devout

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,440
believer a hardcore skeptic or just

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,079
curious about different perspectives

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,239
you're in the right

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,359
place our mission is to to explore to

25
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:07,200
challenge our assumptions and to open

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,479
our minds to new possibilities you ready

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,479
let's

28
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,240
go first off let's define our terms when

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,079
we say God we usually mean an all

30
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:23,759
powerful all- knowing Creator who rules

31
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,759
the universe right well here's the thing

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,400
the Buddha himself never really focused

33
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,920
on this idea he was more interested in

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,320
solving the problem of human suffering

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,240
uffing in the Here and Now not

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,399
speculating about ultimate origins in

37
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,640
fact when asked about the nature of God

38
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,799
and the universe the Buddha often

39
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,840
remained silent saying these questions

40
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,600
were irrelevant to the path of

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,159
Liberation fast forward a few centuries

42
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,159
and we find most Buddhist Traditions

43
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,960
embracing a non-theistic

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,320
worldview now this doesn't necessarily

45
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,719
mean they're atheists some Buddhists

46
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,360
believe in various deities and

47
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,479
supernatural beings but these are seen

48
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,560
more as simp symbolic representations of

49
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:06,399
enlightened qualities not as all

50
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,479
powerful creators so why the departure

51
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,720
from the Creator God idea well at its

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,640
core Buddhism is all about

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,400
self-empowerment the Buddha taught that

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,879
every single one of us has the innate

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,360
wisdom and compassion to free ourselves

56
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,800
from suffering we don't need to rely on

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,959
any external savior or deity the key to

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,360
Liberation lies within it's like having

59
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,560
a superhero hiding inside us just

60
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,920
waiting to be

61
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,120
Unleashed this idea of radical person

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,519
personal responsibility is a total game

63
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,319
Cher it means that our happiness and

64
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,640
spiritual growth are in our own hands we

65
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,840
can't just pray or make offerings and

66
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,480
expect some Divine being to solve our

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,400
problems the Buddha's final words were

68
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,480
be a lamp unto yourself in other words

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,840
trust your own wisdom question

70
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,280
everything and don't blindly follow any

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,920
leader or doctrine but wait it gets even

72
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,959
more interesting Buddhists also believe

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,000
in karma and rebirth the idea that our

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,319
actions have consequences that shape our

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,840
future experiences both in this life and

76
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,760
Beyond it's like a cosmic game of cause

77
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,799
and effect and here's the kicker there's

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,440
no need for a Divine judge or Heavenly

79
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,760
accountant keeping score we're the ones

80
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,680
who set our own destiny in motion

81
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,480
reaping what we sow this concept of

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,519
Karma ties into another core Buddhist

83
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:30,959
teaching the idea of nonself or an Nat

84
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,080
buckle up because this one's a doozy

85
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,239
basically Buddhism says that everything

86
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,120
including our sense of self is

87
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,080
impermanent and constantly changing

88
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,840
there's no fixed Eternal Soul that was

89
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,720
created by some Divine being instead

90
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,280
we're more like ever shifting streams of

91
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,720
thoughts feelings and

92
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,280
experiences if this sounds trippy you're

93
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,599
not alone philosophers have grappled

94
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,480
with this idea for centuries but the

95
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,599
Buddha's point was that clinging to a

96
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,400
false sense of self is a major source of

97
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:03,680
suffering by letting go of our ego and

98
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,560
embracing the flow of change we can find

99
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,040
true Freedom now all of this might sound

100
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,400
pretty abstract and intellectual but the

101
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Buddha was all about direct experience

102
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,120
he didn't want us to just take his word

103
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,680
for it he wanted us to taste the truth

104
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,759
for ourselves that's why Buddhism places

105
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,759
so much emphasis on meditation and

106
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,440
mindful living by observing our own

107
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,560
minds and cultivating awareness we can

108
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,440
cut through the Illusions and discover

109
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,400
the ultimate nature of reality

110
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,160
and that's the Crux of the matter

111
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,720
Buddhists believe that the highest truth

112
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,759
is beyond words Concepts and even

113
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,280
beliefs it can only be known through

114
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,919
direct Insight so rather than arguing

115
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,000
about the existence of God Buddhism

116
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,039
invites us to embark on a personal

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,880
journey of

118
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:51,080
self-discovery it's like a spiritual

119
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,680
treasure hunt with the Ultimate Prize

120
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,479
being the realization of our own

121
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,240
boundless wisdom and compassion this

122
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,160
emphasis on Direct experience over

123
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,639
belief has led to some pretty radical

124
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,199
developments in Buddhist history take

125
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,840
the story of the Buddha's disciple

126
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,919
saruta one day a Wandering aesthetic

127
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,960
challenged saruta saying you Buddhists

128
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:16,160
don't believe in God so your path is

129
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:19,000
incomplete saruta replied friend even if

130
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,639
a Creator God exists that's no reason to

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,280
abandon the Buddhist path we follow the

132
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,360
Buddha's teachings because we've seen

133
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,240
for ourselves that they lead to peace

134
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,639
and Liberation not because of Blind

135
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,000
Faith or consider the kalas sua a famous

136
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,120
Buddhist scripture where the Buddha

137
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,759
tells a group of Skeptics not to blindly

138
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,680
believe anything even his own teachings

139
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,720
he urges them to question investigate

140
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,880
and test the truth for themselves don't

141
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,520
go by reports by Legends by Traditions

142
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,319
by scripture by logical conjecture by

143
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,080
inference by analogies by agreement

144
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:58,440
through pondering views by probability

145
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,160
or by the thought this monk is our

146
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,680
teacher when when you know for

147
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,680
yourselves that certain things are UNH

148
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,080
wholesome wrong and bad then give them

149
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,400
up and when you know for yourselves that

150
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,000
certain things are wholesome and good

151
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,000
then accept them and follow

152
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,000
them wow we've covered a lot of ground

153
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,280
today the Buddhist perspective on God

154
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,800
might be controversial but it challenges

155
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,800
us to rethink our assumptions about

156
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,360
spirituality instead of relying on

157
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,319
external saviors or abstract beliefs

158
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,280
Buddhism urges us to look within to

159
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:32,720
question question deeply and to trust

160
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,800
our own

161
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,080
experience whether you agree with these

162
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,120
ideas or not you got to admit that's a

163
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,759
pretty bold and empowering approach of

164
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,400
course this is just a taste of the rich

165
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,800
dialogue between Buddhism and theism and

166
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,720
hey don't just take my word for it I
