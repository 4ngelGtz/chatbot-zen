1
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:08,541
did you know

2
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,958
that Buddhism has its own version of the devil

3
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:13,250
and unlike the Christian Satan

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,416
this demonic figure has three daughters

5
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:18,375
who each specialize in a different type of temptation

6
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,000
right now

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,541
these three seductive forces are working to trap you

8
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:25,875
in endless suffering without you even realizing it

9
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:27,916
today

10
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,916
we're diving into the dark side of Buddhist mythology

11
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:35,083
to meet Mara the closest thing Buddhism has to Satan

12
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,500
and his three daughters

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,750
who represent the most powerful temptations

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,791
humans face

15
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,625
the crazy part

16
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,291
their tactics haven't changed in 2,500 years

17
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,208
and they're still working on us today

18
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,750
even through our smartphones

19
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,333
stay with me

20
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,833
because knowing how to spot these three temptresses

21
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,541
might be the key to breaking free from the cycles

22
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,625
keeping you stuck

23
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,666
hey wisdom seekers

24
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,500
Matt here and today

25
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,916
we're getting into something wild

26
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,125
from Buddhist tradition

27
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,875
before Buddhism spread worldwide

28
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,166
before meditation became trendy

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,458
the Buddha himself

30
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,500
faced an epic showdown with a powerful

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,916
supernatural being

32
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:18,875
his name was Mara the Lord of death and desire

33
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:22,166
the king of Distraction Buddhism's ultimate villain

34
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,250
but Mara wasn't working alone

35
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,750
he had three daughters

36
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:29,083
each representing a different kind of temptation

37
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,166
that humans just can't seem to resist

38
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:34,416
their names Tanhā craving

39
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,125
Arati boredom

40
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,458
discontent and Rāga

41
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,458
passion lust

42
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,125
three psychological forces so powerful

43
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,333
they've kept humans trapped in suffering

44
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,916
for thousands of years

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,708
what makes this story so fascinating

46
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,375
isn't just the mythology

47
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,583
it's how perfectly it describes the psychological traps

48
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,875
we all fall into every single day

49
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,666
even with our modern technology and lifestyles

50
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,833
picture this

51
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,958
the future Buddha sitting under the Bodhi tree

52
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,625
determined to find the answer to all suffering

53
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,125
the night is dark stars filling the sky

54
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,083
and Siddhartha

55
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,125
Gautama is this close to breaking through

56
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,500
to complete enlightenment

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,208
but suddenly the air shifts

58
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,291
something's coming something powerful

59
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,916
and it does not want Buddha to succeed

60
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,750
Mara's voice slithers through the darkness

61
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,375
turn back princeling

62
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,541
this path leads nowhere your kingdom awaits you

63
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,916
your family needs you why torture yourself for nothing

64
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,875
this is Mara

65
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,208
in that legendary night

66
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,375
as Buddha sat in deep meditation

67
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,916
Mara unleashed everything he had

68
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:53,000
first his demon armies with weapons and fire

69
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,208
then powerful storms and earthquakes

70
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,791
but Buddha remained unmoved

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,750
seriously the guy didn't even flinch

72
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,125
when physical attacks failed

73
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,250
Mara tried something smarter

74
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,958
he sent his three daughters

75
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,875
to seduce and distract Buddha

76
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,250
with the three things humans can rarely resist

77
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:16,125
craving boredom and lust

78
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,583
ancient texts describe them as appearing in forms

79
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,666
designed to appeal to different temperaments

80
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,583
sometimes as alluring dancers

81
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,458
sometimes as nurturing mothers

82
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,208
sometimes as wise teachers

83
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,041
whatever form would most likely

84
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,250
succeed in pulling Buddha from his meditation

85
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,250
they would assume

86
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,041
yet their true power wasn't in their appearance

87
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:37,166
but in the mental states they evoked

88
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,250
but we'll get to those temptresses in a minute

89
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,208
so who exactly is this Mara character

90
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,791
in Buddhist tradition Mara isn't just some random demon

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,375
he's basically the Lord of death itself

92
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,458
his name literally means destroyer

93
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,041
he represents everything

94
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,125
that keeps us trapped in cycles of suffering

95
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,333
but here's where it gets interesting

96
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,666
and very different from the Christian Satan

97
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,500
Mara isn't some separate

98
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,541
evil force battling against good

99
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,666
he's more like the voice in your head saying

100
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,666
just one more episode just one more cookie

101
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,083
just check Instagram one more time

102
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,541
he's not trying to steal your soul

103
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,750
he's trying to steal your attention

104
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,541
your focus your mental freedom

105
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,708
in Buddhist cosmology

106
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,750
Mara rules over the highest heaven of the desire realm

107
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,166
imagine that

108
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,833
the Buddhist devil lives in a kind of heaven

109
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,166
this tells us something super

110
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,083
important about Buddhist psychology

111
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,291
the most dangerous traps

112
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,458
often disguise themselves as pleasures

113
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:41,125
now there's a big debate among Buddhist scholars

114
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,041
was Mara a literal demon that Buddha faced

115
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,625
or was he a personification of Buddha's own

116
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,875
internal struggles the mental obstacles we all face

117
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,750
the coolest part it doesn't really matter

118
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,166
because whether Mara is real

119
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,000
or just a powerful metaphor

120
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,916
the effect is the same

121
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,291
he represents the forces that keep us from freedom

122
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:04,416
consider

123
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,833
the last time you were determined to start a new habit

124
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:10,583
maybe meditation or exercise or eating better

125
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:14,333
but then something pulled you away

126
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,583
something distracted you

127
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,291
something made you doubt yourself

128
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,500
that was Mara

129
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,708
and what makes Mara scarier than the western devil

130
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,666
Satan tempts you to break rules

131
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,166
Mara tempts you to break promises to yourself

132
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,750
Satan wants your soul in the afterlife

133
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,791
Mara wants your mind right now

134
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,541
in the famous Sutta Nipata

135
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,208
an ancient Buddhist text

136
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,916
Buddha describes Mara as

137
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,250
the one who delights in sensual pleasure

138
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,166
not because pleasure itself is bad

139
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:48,125
but because getting lost in temporary pleasures

140
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:51,958
keeps us from finding lasting happiness

141
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:53,958
now

142
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,875
most religious traditions have some kind of evil figure

143
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,458
but Mara is unique

144
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,500
because the Buddha never said to worship anything

145
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,958
to defeat him no rituals

146
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,208
no prayers no special ceremonies

147
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,791
instead the Buddha taught something radical

148
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,833
the way to defeat Mara is simply to see him clearly

149
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,041
to recognize when your mind is being pulled by craving

150
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,166
to notice when you're being manipulated by desire

151
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,166
as Buddha himself supposedly said

152
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,500
I see you Mara

153
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,916
those four words changed everything

154
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,833
because once you see the traps

155
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,500
it loses its power over you

156
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,458
but Mara's greatest strength

157
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,708
his three daughters

158
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,375
each specialized in a different type of temptation

159
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,125
each designed to exploit

160
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,083
a different weakness in the human mind

161
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,958
and that's where our story gets really interesting

162
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,291
so let's meet daughter No. 1

163
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,875
Tanhā whose name literally means thirst or craving

164
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,500
of all of Mara's daughters

165
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,833
she might be the one you spend the most time with

166
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,750
maybe without even realizing it

167
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,000
imagine that feeling when you really want something

168
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:06,083
like need it that pull in your chest

169
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:09,000
that sense that you won't be happy until you get it

170
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,166
that's Tanhā working her magic

171
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:15,500
in the ancient texts Tanhā is described as the maker

172
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,416
of the fetters that bind people to the cycle of rebirth

173
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:22,416
pretty heavy stuff but in simple terms

174
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,250
she's why you can't eat just one potato chip

175
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,666
Tanhā whispers just one more scroll

176
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,666
one more purchase one more bite

177
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,166
then you'll feel complete

178
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,541
Buddha identified Tanhā as the root cause of suffering

179
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,583
in his famous four noble truths

180
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,458
that's right of all the problems humans face

181
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,041
he pointed to craving as the biggest one

182
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,541
but why is wanting things so bad

183
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,458
don't we need desires to function

184
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,708
to have goals

185
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,625
the Buddha never said desires themselves

186
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,750
were the problem it's clinging to them

187
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,791
the difference is subtle but crucial

188
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,125
think about it like this you want a new phone

189
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,708
nothing wrong with that but then

190
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:03,666
you become convinced

191
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,625
you can't be happy without that phone

192
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,875
you check prices every day

193
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,125
you imagine how much better life will be

194
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,541
once you have it you get irritated waiting for it

195
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,875
that's when Tanhā has hooked you

196
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,750
and she's gotten so much better at her job

197
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,291
in the modern world social media

198
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,000
Tanhā's playground

199
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,750
every scroll designed to make you want something new

200
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,833
every influencer showing you a life you don't have

201
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,083
every targeted ad

202
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,291
perfectly matched to your secret desires

203
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,416
in an ancient Buddhist text called the Dhammapada

204
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,458
Buddha says from craving springs grief

205
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,083
from craving springs fear

206
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,416
for one who is wholly free from craving

207
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,125
there is no grief much less fear

208
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,375
modern science actually backs this up

209
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,458
studies show that the dopamine hit we get

210
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,541
isn't actually from getting what we want

211
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,541
it comes from the anticipation

212
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:57,208
the wanting itself that's why satisfaction never lasts

213
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,375
the brain is literally wired to keep wanting more

214
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,041
but here's the twist

215
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,541
Tanhā doesn't just make us want stuff

216
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,166
she comes in three flavors

217
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,833
first there's craving for sensual pleasures

218
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,416
the obvious one food

219
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,666
sex comfort

220
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,375
the newest iPhone

221
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:17,833
second

222
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,000
there's craving for existence

223
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,166
the desire to be someone to achieve

224
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,083
to be important to leave a mark

225
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,125
think social media followers and career ambition

226
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,791
and third there's the weird one

227
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,625
craving for non existence

228
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:36,208
the desire to escape to numb out

229
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,833
to not feel this is why we binge Netflix

230
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,333
drink too much or scroll mindlessly for hours

231
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,750
the Buddha taught that all three types keep us trapped

232
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,041
so how do you know when Tanhā is working on you

233
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:52,583
look for these signs that feeling of I'll be happy when

234
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:53,791
that's her

235
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,500
that itch to check your phone every five minutes

236
00:09:56,666 --> 00:10:00,291
that's her that sense that what you have isn't enough

237
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,750
definitely her

238
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,250
so how did Buddha recommend

239
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,750
dealing with his first daughter

240
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,666
not by fighting her not by giving in either

241
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,750
but by seeing the craving clearly

242
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,833
and understanding its empty nature

243
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,208
in his own words from the Majjhima Nikaya

244
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,291
whatever in the world is pleasant and agreeable toward

245
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,708
this craving arises

246
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,333
seeing its arising and passing away as it actually is

247
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,500
that's the path to its cessation

248
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,000
simply put when you feel that craving rise up

249
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,333
don't judge it don't fear it

250
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,416
just notice it oh

251
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,708
there's craving watch it rise

252
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,250
watch it eventually fade without acting on it

253
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,416
try this experiment next time you feel a powerful want

254
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,125
set a timer for just 10 minutes before giving in

255
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,833
just observe the feeling

256
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,208
you might be shocked to discover that many cravings

257
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,708
naturally fade on their own

258
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,250
when not fed with attention

259
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,541
the more you practice this

260
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,250
the more you'll start to notice the space

261
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,750
between wanting something

262
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,708
and deciding to pursue it

263
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,375
that space

264
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,916
that's where your freedom lives

265
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:15,000
now let's talk about Mara's second daughter Arati

266
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:18,000
her name translates to boredom or discontent

267
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,041
and she might be the quietest

268
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,416
yet most dangerous of the three

269
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,208
while her sister Tanhā

270
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,833
makes you chase what you don't have

271
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,875
Arati makes you dissatisfied with what you do have

272
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,416
she's that voice whispering

273
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,625
is this all there is this is boring

274
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,625
there must be something better

275
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,625
in the ancient texts

276
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,958
Buddha described Arati as a force that creates

277
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,916
restlessness and discontentment

278
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,791
and if you look closely

279
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
you'll see her fingerprints everywhere

280
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,250
in modern life

281
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,250
Arati murmurs this meditation is pointless

282
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,291
you could be doing something productive

283
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,958
anything would be better than this emptiness

284
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,791
when was the last time you just sat quietly

285
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,583
for 10 minutes no phone

286
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,500
no TV no music

287
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,041
no conversation

288
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,541
just sitting hard right

289
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,708
that discomfort you feel that's Arati

290
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,291
a study at the university of Virginia

291
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,666
found something crazy

292
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,458
people would rather give themselves electric shocks

293
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,291
than sit alone with their thoughts for just 15 minutes

294
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,291
let that sink in

295
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,375
actual physical pain seem better than boredom

296
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,333
Arati has leveled up in the smartphone era

297
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,708
that urge to pull out your phone in an elevator

298
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,416
during commercials even in the bathroom

299
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,583
that's her work

300
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,875
the average person now checks their phone

301
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,875
about 150 times a day not because we need to

302
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,458
but because we can't stand

303
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,625
the emptiness of an unoccupied moment

304
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,583
Buddha recognized this human tendency

305
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,875
thousands of years ago in the Pali texts

306
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,458
he uses the term abhijappā

307
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,583
a kind of mental restlessness

308
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,375
that prevents peace of mind

309
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,583
he observed that humans have this weird tendency

310
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,875
we're constantly bouncing between craving and aversion

311
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,708
wanting and rejecting

312
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
never content with the simple experience of now

313
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,208
Arati especially loves to attack during meditation

314
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,833
that sudden thought that this is pointless

315
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,166
the fidgeting the checking how much time is left

316
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,958
the planning what you'll do after all her tactics

317
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,625
Buddha never condemned boredom itself

318
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:32,416
only our reaction to it in the Satipatthana Sutta

319
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,250
the Buddha's central teaching on mindfulness meditation

320
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,958
Buddha teaches when the mind has restlessness

321
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,708
one knows my mind has restlessness

322
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,041
this simple awareness starts to dissolve Arati's power

323
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,375
you see Arati's whole game depends on you

324
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,875
not noticing her influence

325
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,416
she wants your discontent to feel natural inevitable

326
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,416
she wants you reaching for distraction automatically

327
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,791
the next time you feel that itchy boredom sensation

328
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,666
try something radical

329
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,875
don't immediately reach for distraction

330
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,250
instead get curious about the feeling itself

331
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,541
where do you feel it in your body

332
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,541
what's it actually like to be bored

333
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,958
is it really as unbearable as it seems

334
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,833
neuroscience now confirms that this boredom

335
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,791
avoidance habit literally reshapes our brains

336
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,208
making us less able to focus

337
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,250
less creative and ironically

338
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,083
more prone to feeling bored

339
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,291
some of the most powerful meditation traditions

340
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,583
directly challenge Arati Zen

341
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,875
practices like just sitting

342
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,875
Vipassana's body scanning

343
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,750
these aren't just spiritual exercises

344
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,958
they're training in a Arati-resistance

345
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,625
the Buddha taught that true contentment

346
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,958
comes from within not from constant stimulation

347
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,083
as he reportedly said

348
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,583
there is no higher happiness than peace

349
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,083
and peace isn't the absence of boredom

350
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:57,875
it's freedom

351
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,041
from being controlled by the fear of boredom

352
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,583
so next time

353
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,333
you feel that pull

354
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,375
to check your phone for the hundredth time

355
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,708
or switch to a new YouTube video after 30 seconds

356
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:12,500
remember Arati take a breath and maybe

357
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:17,041
just maybe choose to sit with the discomfort instead

358
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,208
because here's the secret Buddha discovered

359
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,458
on the other side of boredom lies something amazing

360
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,875
a kind of natural joy and curiosity

361
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,750
that only appears

362
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,958
when we stop running from the present moment

363
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,541
now we come to Mara's third daughter

364
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,500
and possibly his secret weapon

365
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,541
Rāga whose name means passion or lust

366
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,541
of the three sisters

367
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,708
she might be the most misunderstood

368
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,791
when Buddha talks about Rāga

369
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,541
he's not just talking about sexual desire though

370
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,125
that's definitely part of it

371
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,291
he's talking about that fiery

372
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:57,500
intense attachment to anything that clouds our judgment

373
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,791
think of that rush

374
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,875
when you're intensely attracted to someone

375
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,166
or that burning need to be recognized

376
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,541
or that passionate conviction that you're right

377
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,166
and everyone else is wrong

378
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,291
that's Rāga doing her thing

379
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,125
in the Anguttara Nikaya Buddha says

380
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,541
just as a tree cut down sprouts again

381
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,500
if its roots remain unharmed

382
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,500
suffering repeatedly arises

383
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,708
as long as the tendency of passion is not rooted out

384
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:26,000
Rāga beckens follow this feeling wherever it leads

385
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,291
nothing matters but this moment of desire

386
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,291
surrender completely

387
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,375
unlike her sisters who make us feel bad

388
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,250
Rāga  makes us feel good really good

389
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,375
sometimes so good we lose ourselves completely

390
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,000
and unlike craving

391
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
which is about wanting what we don't have

392
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,000
or boredom which is about not wanting what we do have

393
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:46,875
passion

394
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,416
is about getting lost in what we're experiencing

395
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,375
now it's super important to understand

396
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,083
Buddha never said passion itself was bad

397
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,750
he wasn't anti pleasure or anti fun

398
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,416
but he warned about becoming a slave to passion

399
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:05,375
the difference is key healthy desire moves you forward

400
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,125
Rāga's Trap makes you obsessed

401
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,625
think about those moments

402
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,000
when you've been completely controlled by a feeling

403
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,083
maybe intense jealousy

404
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:17,500
or overwhelming infatuation or blinding anger

405
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,083
did you make your best decisions in those states

406
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,125
probably not

407
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,000
modern society worships passion

408
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,458
follow your passion live passionately

409
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,166
but Buddha offered a more nuanced perspective

410
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,791
he taught that passionate feelings

411
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,041
while powerful are also passing

412
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,916
they rise and fall like weather

413
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,875
and building your life around chasing those intense

414
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:44,916
emotional highs

415
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,500
is like trying to warm yourself with lightning

416
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,583
in our world

417
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,916
Rāga works through some pretty obvious channels

418
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,125
the entire dating app industry

419
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,666
the way politics turns us against each other

420
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,583
through righteous anger celebrity worship

421
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,958
even hustle culture

422
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,333
that glorifies burning yourself out for success

423
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,500
but Buddha offered a fascinating perspective

424
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,458
on working with passionate feelings

425
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,583
in a famous teaching called the Fire Sermon

426
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:15,541
Buddha compared all our sensory experiences to a fire

427
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,875
not something to be feared

428
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,958
but something to be understood as impermanent

429
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,666
and ultimately unsatisfying when clung to

430
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,458
so how do we deal with Rāga's influence

431
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,500
not by suppressing passion

432
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,666
that never works

433
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:33,041
but by developing a mindful relationship with it

434
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,250
when intense emotions arise

435
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,541
Buddhist practice suggests

436
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,791
observing them with friendly curiosity

437
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,583
oh there's anger

438
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,000
there's attraction not judging

439
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,625
not feeding just seeing clearly

440
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,000
the Buddha taught a practice called

441
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,375
guarding the sense doors

442
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,833
this doesn't mean shutting yourself off from experience

443
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,750
it means staying aware of how sights sounds

444
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,208
tastes touches

445
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,166
smells and thoughts affect your mind

446
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:04,458
a simple practice when you notice passion arising pause

447
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,875
take three conscious breaths

448
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,750
notice where you feel the emotion in your body

449
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,750
this tiny gap creates space for wisdom

450
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,708
a verse from the Theragatha

451
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,541
an ancient Buddhist text says

452
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,666
from passion springs grief

453
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,583
from passion springs fear

454
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,083
for one who is wholly free from passion

455
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,583
there is no grief much less fear

456
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,000
the goal isn't to become some emotionless robot

457
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,500
the goal is freedom from emotions

458
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,333
rather than freedom of emotions

459
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,250
see the difference

460
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,500
of all Mara's daughters

461
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,291
she's the one who can most easily be transformed

462
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:44,291
passionate energy when channeled with wisdom

463
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,916
can fuel compassion

464
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:49,083
creativity and even spiritual awakening

465
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,083
some Buddhist traditions

466
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:54,041
even talk about transforming poison into medicine

467
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,875
using the energy of passion

468
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,750
while staying free from its control

469
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,125
and this is where our story takes an unexpected turn

470
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,500
let's go back to that night under the Bodhi Tree

471
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,833
the future Buddha surrounded by Mara's armies

472
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,583
tempted by his three daughters

473
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,166
everything at stake

474
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,708
what did Buddha do that was so powerful

475
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,166
so revolutionary

476
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:23,000
that it's still changing lives 2,500 years later

477
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,375
first he didn't fight

478
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,583
imagine that faced with literal demons

479
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,791
he didn't raise a weapon he didn't even stand up

480
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,416
instead he performed one simple

481
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,625
profound gesture that echoes through time

482
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,166
Buddha extended his right hand downward

483
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,500
fingertips brushing the earth beneath him

484
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,750
this single touch the Bhumisparma Mudra

485
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,500
connected him to something immovable

486
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,000
authentic and true

487
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,958
with this gesture Buddha silently declared

488
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,250
I see you Mara

489
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,208
but what does it mean

490
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,708
the gesture was Buddha calling the earth itself

491
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,208
as his witness basically saying

492
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,625
I belong here

493
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,625
I have the right to seek liberation

494
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,958
and nothing can stop me

495
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,750
the power wasn't in some magical spell

496
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,083
or divine intervention

497
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,791
the power was in Buddha's awareness

498
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,791
his complete presence his refusal

499
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,583
to be distracted from truth

500
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,291
as the story goes when Buddha touched the earth

501
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,583
Mara and his daughters

502
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,083
couldn't maintain their illusions

503
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,125
the armies vanished the temptations lost their power

504
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,208
and Buddha achieved enlightenment

505
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,250
becoming the awakened one

506
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,041
this isn't merely ancient legend

507
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,333
Buddha left us a roadmap to create our own

508
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,666
earth touching moments the core of Buddha's approach

509
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,083
mindfulness that's just a fancy word for clear

510
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,916
non judgmental awareness of what's happening right now

511
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,083
inside and outside

512
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,041
modern science shows this works

513
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,000
a 2015 study from Brown University

514
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,666
found that mindfulness meditation

515
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,333
actually changes brain activity

516
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,208
in the regions associated with craving

517
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,916
and emotional reactivity

518
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,500
another study from University College London

519
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,083
showed that mindfulness techniques

520
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,500
were more effective for breaking unwanted habits

521
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,875
than willpower alone

522
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,000
so how does awareness defeat each daughter

523
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,083
for Tanhā

524
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,750
craving awareness shows us the empty nature of wanting

525
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,000
we see how the mind creates a story

526
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,541
that this thing will make me happy

527
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:25,958
and we can choose not to believe it

528
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,000
for Arati boredom

529
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,875
awareness reveals the richness of the present moment

530
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,083
the more closely we pay attention

531
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,458
the more interesting even boring experiences become

532
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,500
for Rāga passion

533
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,750
awareness creates space between the feeling

534
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,791
and our response

535
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,791
we can feel the heat without getting burned

536
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,916
we can experience desire without being controlled by it

537
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,000
in the Satipatthana Sutta

538
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,666
Buddha offers a simple but profound instruction

539
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,500
when walking know I am walking

540
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,291
when standing know I am standing

541
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,666
when sitting know I am sitting

542
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,500
when lying down know I am lying down

543
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,208
this isn't just about labeling activities

544
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:11,041
it's about bringing full awareness to every moment

545
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,375
leaving no room for Mara and his daughters

546
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:16,750
to slip in unnoticed Buddha famously said

547
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:19,250
all that we are arises with our thoughts

548
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,000
with our thoughts we make the world

549
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,708
this isn't just philosophy

550
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,833
it's practical psychology

551
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,208
our thoughts create our reality

552
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,958
when we see clearly without the distortions of craving

553
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:36,791
boredom or blind passion we experience freedom

554
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,833
Buddha's revolutionary insight reveals

555
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,750
that victory over Mara isn't a one time battle

556
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,750
but a moment by moment practice

557
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,958
even after his enlightenment

558
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,375
Buddha reported that Mara still appeared to him

559
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,333
the difference was Buddha could always see him clearly

560
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,791
I see you Mara

561
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,125
this is what victory looks like in real life

562
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,916
not the absence of temptation

563
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,708
but the presence of awareness that gives us choice

564
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,083
what does this look like in practice

565
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:10,125
when you feel the urge to buy something you don't need

566
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,333
I see you Tanhā

567
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,500
when you feel restless during a quiet moment

568
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,375
I see you Arati

569
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,375
when you feel overwhelmed by attraction or anger

570
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:24,000
I see you Rāga just this simple recognition

571
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,041
this naming of the force at work

572
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,666
cuts its power dramatically

573
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,125
as Buddha taught

574
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:32,041
just as a solid rock is not shaken by the wind

575
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,375
the wise are not shaken by praise or blame

576
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,833
with practice we develop the stability

577
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:39,000
that can't be moved by Mara's tricks

578
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:45,625
so what's the big takeaway here

579
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:48,500
are Mara and his daughters real supernatural beings

580
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:51,041
or just symbols for psychological forces

581
00:24:51,666 --> 00:24:53,416
it doesn't actually matter

582
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,333
whether you see them as literal demons

583
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,375
or as metaphors for states of mind

584
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,000
the practice is exactly the same

585
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,875
recognize them name them

586
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:05,916
don't fight them don't follow them

587
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,916
just see them clearly

588
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:09,625
different

589
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:12,250
Buddhist traditions approach Mara in unique ways

590
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,500
Theravada often emphasizes Mara

591
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,291
as representing

592
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,666
the five aggregates that bind us to suffering

593
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:20,833
Mahayana traditions sometimes portray Mara as

594
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:23,500
ultimately empty of inherent existence

595
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:26,916
himself subject to dependent origination

596
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:30,083
Vajrayana might view Mara's energies as

597
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,833
potentially transformable

598
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,541
into enlightened awareness

599
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:35,333
through specialized practices

600
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:38,458
the daughters of Mara are working on all of us

601
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:40,958
all the time every advertisement

602
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,625
every social media feed

603
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,833
every moment of consumer culture

604
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:47,083
plays on these same three forces

605
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:49,541
but here's the mystery I promised you

606
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:52,458
what if Mara's daughters aren't our enemies after all

607
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:54,958
what if Mara's daughters are actually our greatest

608
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:56,166
teachers in disguise

609
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:58,583
Tanhā doesn't just create suffering

610
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:00,500
she reveals where we're still attached

611
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:01,500
each craving

612
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,791
points precisely to what we need to examine

613
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:07,375
the stronger the wanting the more important the lesson

614
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:10,208
Arati doesn't just make us uncomfortable

615
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:12,416
she invites us into the present moment

616
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,333
her restlessness

617
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:17,541
challenges us to discover what lies beyond distraction

618
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:19,833
the spaces she makes us avoid

619
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,625
contain our deepest insights

620
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:24,333
Rāga doesn't just cloud our judgment

621
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,333
she shows us the power of our own energy

622
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:30,625
her fire when recognized and channeled

623
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,166
transforms into the warmth

624
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:34,541
of compassion and the light of wisdom

625
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,166
the daughters aren't obstacles on the path

626
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:38,833
they are the path

627
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,208
these challenges aren't punishment

628
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,541
they're the training ground

629
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,166
the gym where we build our spiritual muscles

630
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,875
as one Zen master put it no mud

631
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:50,416
no lotus without the challenges

632
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:51,791
there's no growth

633
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,625
so next time you feel craving pull at you

634
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,833
or boredom push you toward distraction

635
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,958
or passion cloud your judgment

636
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,625
try something new

637
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:03,791
instead of seeing it as a failure or a problem

638
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:07,250
see it as an opportunity a chance to practice awareness

639
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,250
a chance to touch the earth

640
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:12,541
and remember what Buddha discovered under that tree

641
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:14,750
the power of Mara and his daughters

642
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,125
only works when we don't see them clearly

643
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:19,416
the moment we recognize them

644
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:21,375
we're already free

645
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,458
so wisdom seekers keep your eyes open

646
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:27,791
the daughters of Mara are everywhere

647
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:30,250
in your phone in your mind

648
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,416
in your daily life but with awareness

649
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,791
their temptations become your teachers

650
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,000
which of Mara's daughters visits you most often

651
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:41,000
is it Tanhā's endless wanting

652
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,958
Arati's restless boredom or Rāga's consuming passion

653
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:48,291
share your experience in the comments below

654
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:52,000
and if you found value in today's exploration

655
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,541
help others discover these insights by liking

656
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,583
subscribing and sharing with someone

657
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:58,875
facing their own battle with Mara's daughters

658
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:03,375
until next time this is Matt from Buddha's wisdom

659
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,875
reminding you that the greatest superpower

660
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:07,958
is simply seeing clearly
