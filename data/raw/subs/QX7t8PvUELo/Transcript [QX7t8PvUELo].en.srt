1
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:11,250
what drives someone to stare at a wall for nine years

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,625
straight? you know

3
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:15,541
Kung fu movies? every single one of them

4
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:18,708
exist because of one stubborn monk who refused to move

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,125
I'm Matt and

6
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,625
this is the story Hollywood doesn't want you to know

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,541
meet the monk who stared at a wall for 9 years

8
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:31,500
lost his legs and in the process created Kung fu

9
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:35,083
brought Zen Buddhism to China and possibly gave us tea

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,458
this is the story of Bodhidharma

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,416
the prince who became a legend

12
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,208
everyone loves a good origin story

13
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,666
Batman had his cave Spider Man had his spider bite

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,083
but Bodhidharma?

15
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,125
the man Chinese would call "The Blue-Eyed Barbarian"?

16
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,333
he had something way more intense

17
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,958
born into royalty in ancient India

18
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,500
he had it all wealth

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,458
power luxury at his fingertips

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,416
then one day he walked away from everything

21
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,625
crossing stormy seas to China

22
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,250
where his striking blue eyes and foreign ways

23
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,083
earned him that legendary nickname

24
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,666
this decision would change not just his life

25
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:20,666
but the future of martial arts and Zen Buddhism forever

26
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,666
because this mysterious monk

27
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,583
didn't just transform meditation

28
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,708
he created a tradition of warrior monks

29
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,583
that would inspire generations

30
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,458
those Shaolin monks you've seen in movies?

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,291
their story starts with him

32
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,333
those ancient training methods

33
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,666
that turned monks into warriors?

34
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,416
his teachings

35
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,541
that discipline of mastering both mind and body?

36
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:44,500
his legacy

37
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,083
here's what makes the story truly special

38
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,583
everything Bodhidharma taught centuries ago

39
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:52,708
modern science

40
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:55,125
is just starting to prove he was right all along

41
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,333
so here's your challenge as you watch

42
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,958
by the end of this video you'll need to decide

43
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,375
was Bodhidharma really superhuman

44
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,541
or just the greatest teacher who ever lived?

45
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,333
either way I promise you this

46
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,541
his story will change

47
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,708
how you think about human potential

48
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,208
forever

49
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,083
let's begin

50
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,083
the story of the blue eyed barbarian

51
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,833
starts in a place you wouldn't expect

52
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,750
a palace in South India around 440 AD

53
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,625
born as the third son of the Pallava king

54
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:33,958
Young Bodhidharma

55
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,291
lived a life most of us can only dream about

56
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,458
servants at his Beck and call

57
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,541
the finest education money could buy

58
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,791
and a destiny carved into the palace walls themselves

59
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,291
according to ancient records

60
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,416
Bodhidharma was an imposing figure

61
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,833
beyond his striking blue eyes

62
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,791
that seemed to pierce through illusions

63
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,250
he stood tall with dark skin

64
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,083
weathered by the Indian sun

65
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,500
his thick beard and intense gaze

66
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,625
made him instantly recognizable

67
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,750
even the way he moved caught attention

68
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,500
graceful yet powerful

69
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,541
like a warrior who had found inner peace

70
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,458
but something was different about this prince

71
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,125
while his brothers trained in warfare and politics

72
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:19,666
Bodhidharma

73
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,916
spent hours questioning the royal teachers

74
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,333
about the meaning of life

75
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,458
why are we here?

76
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,333
what's the point of all this luxury?

77
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,958
heavy questions for a young prince

78
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,458
these were the same questions that another Indian

79
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,416
prince had asked

80
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,500
nearly 1,000 years before

81
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,416
that prince became the Buddha

82
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,000
and his teachings had slowly spread across Asia

83
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,625
now they were transforming China

84
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,083
but something was missing

85
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,875
something that only Bodhidharma could provide

86
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,791
then one day everything changed

87
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,583
a wandering Buddhist master named Prajnatara

88
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,500
visited the palace as the story goes

89
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,458
the moment their eyes met

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,791
Prajnatara saw something special in the young prince

91
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,791
this wasn't just another royal

92
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,416
seeking wisdom to show off at parties

93
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,125
this was someone who might actually get it

94
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:15,208
the master's words to the king were simple but shocking

95
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,541
your son isn't meant for the throne

96
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,875
he's meant for something far greater

97
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,000
now imagine

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,666
telling a powerful king

99
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,708
that his son should give up the palace life

100
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,791
to become a monk

101
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,000
most kings would have thrown the master out right there

102
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,583
but something incredible happened

103
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,916
the king agreed what happened next

104
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,000
would make even modern billionaires think twice

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,333
Bodhidharma didn't just give up some of his wealth

106
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:44,125
he gave up everything his royal titles

107
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,500
his precious possessions even his birth name

108
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,083
and that was just the beginning

109
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,375
his master had seen a vision

110
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,958
a vision of Buddhism's future in China

111
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:56,958
and Bodhidharma

112
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,125
he was the only one who could make it happen

113
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,083
but first he had to learn

114
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,541
and not just for a few weeks or months

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,375
we're talking years of intense training

116
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,916
meditation that would break most people

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,458
teachings that would twist your brain into knots

118
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,375
all of this just to prepare him

119
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:19,083
for a journey that most people thought was impossible

120
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,000
remember when you thought a 5 hour flight was rough

121
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,583
try sailing across two oceans in a wooden boat

122
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:35,000
for three years that's exactly what Bodhidharma did

123
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,875
no GPS no weather reports

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,625
just a small trading ship fighting massive waves

125
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,250
dodging pirates and battling storms

126
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,333
that could shatter the vessel into splinters

127
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:49,125
but the real challenges they were waiting on shore

128
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,875
China in the 6th century

129
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,666
was a land of countless kingdoms and fierce rivalries

130
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,416
but it was also experiencing a golden age of Buddhist

131
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,750
exploration with merchants and monks

132
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,958
bringing new ideas along the Silk Road

133
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:07,500
when Bodhidharma finally reached China in 527 AD

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,166
during the Golden Age of the Liang Dynasty

135
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
news of the blue eyed foreign monk spread like wildfire

136
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,333
a mysterious master from India

137
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,625
with eyes that seem to pierce through your soul

138
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,708
everyone wanted to meet him

139
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,375
including the most powerful man in China

140
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,000
Emperor Wu of Liang

141
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,416
this wasn't just any meeting

142
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,916
Emperor Wu had transformed Buddhism in China

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,583
spending a fortune building over 500 temples

144
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,583
copying sacred texts in gold

145
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:41,041
and housing tens of thousands of monks for centuries

146
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,375
after this encounter

147
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,833
would be studied by Zen students

148
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,916
as the moment that defined their tradition

149
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,416
two titans of Buddhism

150
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,083
about to clash in a way no one expected

151
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,166
now Emperor Wu had prepared himself thoroughly

152
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,750
He'd studied Buddhist philosophy for decades

153
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,875
supported countless monasteries

154
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,958
and considered himself the greatest patron

155
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,500
Buddhism had ever known

156
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,708
he had prepared deep philosophical questions that he

157
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,833
was sure would impress this foreign master

158
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,666
their meeting would become legendary

159
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,458
but not for the reasons the emperor hoped

160
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,333
what is the source of all creation?

161
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,666
the emperor asked confident in his profound question

162
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Bodhidharma laughed

163
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,666
what kind of foolish question is that?

164
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,250
ask something else

165
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,458
the entire court froze nobody

166
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,041
nobody had ever dared speak to the emperor like that

167
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,541
red faced but trying to maintain his dignity

168
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,875
Emperor Wu tried again

169
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:49,208
then tell me what is the source of my existence?

170
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,416
this time Bodhidharma laughed even louder

171
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
this is an utterly stupid question

172
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,833
ask something else

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,625
Imagine that scene for a moment the most powerful man in China

174
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,750
used to everyone bowing to his wisdom

175
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,958
being told his deep philosophical questions were stupid

176
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,625
but Bodhidharma wasn't trying to be rude

177
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,833
he was teaching a profound lesson

178
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,500
true wisdom isn't found in grand

179
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,875
philosophical questions but in direct experience

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,375
without another word he turned and walked away

181
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,541
not just from any conversation

182
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,958
he walked away from the Emperor of China

183
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,791
nobody did that ever

184
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,125
but Bodhidharma wasn't interested in imperial favor

185
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,166
or fancy philosophical debates

186
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,583
he had a different destination in mind

187
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,416
a small temple in the middle of nowhere

188
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,708
a place that would soon become legendary

189
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,125
thanks to what he was about to do there

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,875
the Shaolin Temple was waiting

191
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,166
the temple that greeted Bodhidharma

192
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,333
wasn't the mighty fortress you might imagine

193
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,541
just a quiet monastery

194
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,958
tucked away in the song mountain range

195
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,875
but what happened next would turn it into a legend

196
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,625
Bodhidharma walked into the temple

197
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,541
found an empty cave facing a wall

198
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,583
sat down and didn't move for nine years

199
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,500
nine years

200
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,000
just think about that for a second

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,291
most of us can't sit still for 9 minutes

202
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:32,166
this guy sat facing a wall for 9 years

203
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:36,208
but why a wall the answer reveals everything about Zen

204
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,250
no decorations no distractions

205
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,041
no escape from your own mind

206
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,791
just you and a blank wall

207
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,708
until you break through all illusions

208
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,583
the local monks thought he was crazy

209
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,375
they'd watch him sitting there day after day

210
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,041
through blazing summers and freezing winters

211
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,833
some tried to talk to him

212
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,125
others left food most just whispered about the strange

213
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,083
blue eyed monk who wouldn't move

214
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,208
then came the famous night that changed everything

215
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,333
the story goes that

216
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,750
Bodhidharma got so frustrated

217
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,000
with falling asleep during meditation

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,625
he cut off his own eyelids

219
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,875
legend has it that where his eyelids fell

220
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,833
the first tea plants grew

221
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,375
giving us the gift

222
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,541
that would help monk stay awake during meditation

223
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,875
for centuries to come

224
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,250
true story? maybe not

225
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,208
but here's what we do know

226
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:37,166
after years of sitting his legs actually atrofied

227
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,166
the man literally lost the use of his legs

228
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,250
because he sat still for so long

229
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,541
that's not a legend

230
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,250
that's dedication on a whole different level

231
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:47,750
but

232
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,166
something else was happening during those nine years

233
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,500
something that would change the temple forever

234
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,166
the monks who watched him were getting weaker

235
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,500
hours of meditation with no physical training

236
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,041
was taking its toll and Bodhidharma

237
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,000
he was about to revolutionize

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,500
everything they knew about spiritual practice

239
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,333
after nine years of wallgazing

240
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,375
Bodhidharma finally stood up and saw a problem

241
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,083
the monks were weak like really weak

242
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,833
many could barely stay awake during meditation

243
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,375
others were getting sick all the time

244
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:26,875
his solution?

245
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,666
the creation of what we now know is Shaolin Kung Fu

246
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,000
possibly the most famous martial art in history

247
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,750
Bodhidharma gathered the monks

248
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,291
and taught them a series of exercises

249
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,500
he brought from India

250
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,208
but these weren't just any exercises

251
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,041
these movements would become the foundation of Shao Lin

252
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:44,875
Kung Fu

253
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,708
a perfect blend of physical training with meditation

254
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,208
breathing with power stillness with explosive strength

255
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:55,333
the first Kung fu training manual he created was called

256
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,958
The Muscle Tendon Change Classic sounds boring right?

257
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,791
wrong!

258
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,791
this wasn't just any exercise routine

259
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,125
the manual detailed 18 precise movements

260
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,958
each one designed to strengthen both body and mind

261
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,000
from the iron bridge stance

262
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,750
that could make legs unshakable

263
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,250
to the tiger's embrace

264
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,208
that built explosive arm strength

265
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,500
to the dragon's breath that enhanced vital energy

266
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,375
these exercises would become the foundation of

267
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,458
Shaolin's famous "Yi Jin Jing" techniques

268
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,750
so powerful they're still practiced today

269
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,708
these were the original techniques

270
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,625
that would transform peaceful monks

271
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,541
into the legendary Shaolin

272
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,083
Kung Fu masters

273
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,666
each movement of this early Shaolin Kung fu had a

274
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:39,458
purpose

275
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,458
some mimiced animals

276
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,000
others focused on building internal energy

277
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,291
but all of them had one goal

278
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,500
to make the body

279
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,250
strong enough to handle hours of deep meditation

280
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,833
the monks thought he was crazy again

281
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,250
why would peaceful Buddhist monks need to learn Kung Fu

282
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,500
Bodhidharma's answer was simple

283
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,458
the body is the temple of the mind

284
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:07,041
a weak temple cannot protect anything

285
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,375
at first the Shaolin Kung fu training was brutal

286
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,208
monks who thought they were tough

287
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,583
discovered muscles they never knew existed

288
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,333
but something amazing started happening

289
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,916
they got stronger healthier

290
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,375
more focused

291
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,083
their meditation improved

292
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,541
their minds became sharper

293
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,500
soon words spread about these Shaolin Kung fu masters

294
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,125
a new tradition was born

295
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:37,208
one that would inspire countless martial art styles

296
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,791
and spread across Asia

297
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,125
but Bodhidharma wasn't done yet

298
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,750
his next creation would be even more mind blowing

299
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,000
while Shaolin Kung fu trained the body

300
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,125
Bodhidharma's greatest revolution was yet to come

301
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,750
he was about to create something

302
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,583
that would change Buddhism forever

303
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,000
Zen before Bodhidharma

304
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,458
Buddhism in China

305
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,708
was all about studying endless scriptures

306
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,000
and performing complex ceremonies

307
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,500
but he looked at all that and said something shocking

308
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,708
you won't find truth in words or rituals

309
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,208
you'll find it by looking directly into your own mind

310
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,500
this was Zen Direct

311
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:22,875
simple

312
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,000
revolutionary

313
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,875
he taught it through actions that seemed crazy

314
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,791
at the time like that famous wall gazing

315
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,333
it wasn't just stubborn meditation

316
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,291
it was a statement stop looking for answers

317
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,875
and books stop searching for Buddha outside yourself

318
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:44,166
just sit and see who you really are

319
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,791
one story perfectly captures what made Zen so different

320
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,666
a monk came to Bodhidharma and said master

321
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,583
my mind is troubled please help me find peace

322
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,625
Bodhidharma replied

323
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,208
show me your mind and I will put it at peace

324
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,250
the monk said but when I look for my mind

325
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,458
I cannot find it

326
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,458
there

327
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Bodhidharma smiled I have put it at peace boom

328
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,875
that's Zen

329
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,416
don't worry if this seems confusing

330
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,333
we'll dive deep into what Zen really is

331
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,000
in a future video but for now

332
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
just know that body

333
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,416
Dharma's direct approach changed everything

334
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,750
this approach didn't stop in China

335
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,083
over time it influenced Zen traditions in Japan

336
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,916
where it shaped samurai culture

337
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,125
and spread to Korea and Vietnam

338
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,125
becoming a cornerstone of Asian spirituality

339
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:35,666
why?

340
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,250
because it worked

341
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:38,833
in Japan

342
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,250
Zen inspired the samurai disciplined way of life

343
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,000
influencing their code of honor known as Bushido

344
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,833
Korean seon emphasized meditation

345
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:51,041
practices that are still widely practiced today

346
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,708
and in the modern world Zen’s focus on mindfulness

347
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:58,291
simplicity and direct experience has inspired art

348
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,208
poetry and even business philosophies

349
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,291
particularly in western countries

350
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,166
it cut through all the complicated philosophy

351
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,000
and got straight to the point

352
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,041
you want to understand your mind?

353
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,375
sit down and look at it you want to find truth?

354
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,500
stop searching and see what's already here

355
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,625
but just as Zen was taking root in China

356
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,041
something strange happened to its founder

357
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,416
this is where Bodhidharma's story gets really weird

358
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,333
after spending nearly three decades

359
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:37,458
creating both Shaolin Kung Fu and Zen Buddhism

360
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:42,666
he vanished like literally vanished

361
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,416
here's where things get interesting

362
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:49,083
three legendary stories describe what happened to him

363
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,666
and each one is stranger than the last

364
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,125
according to one story

365
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,333
jealous rivals tried to poison him six times

366
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,625
he survived each attempt

367
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,250
until the sixth poison finally worked

368
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,291
but when his followers opened his tomb years later

369
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,166
they found only one thing

370
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:12,208
a single old sandal

371
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,416
another story says he never died at all

372
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,208
three years after his supposed death

373
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,583
a government official

374
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,791
was traveling through the mountains

375
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,375
between China and India

376
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,541
when he saw something incredible

377
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,958
an old monk walking barefoot

378
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,833
carrying a staff with a single sandal hanging from it

379
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,416
when the official asked who he was

380
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,666
the monk replied

381
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,708
I'm heading back to India

382
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,708
that monk he looked exactly like Bodhidharma

383
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,333
the third story

384
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,375
some say he achieved his final enlightenment in a cave

385
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,500
high in the mountains

386
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,291
where his body dissolved into pure light

387
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,541
leaving behind only you guessed it

388
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,416
a single sandal one sandal

389
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,083
three different stories it's like

390
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,500
the ancient Chinese version of a mystery thriller

391
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,708
while many of these stories mix history with legend

392
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,333
archaeological evidence confirms Bodiharma's presence

393
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,208
at Shaolin Temple

394
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,583
through ancient manuscripts and temple records

395
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,541
stone carvings from that era still show a foreign monk

396
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,000
with distinct features

397
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,375
teaching both meditation and martial arts

398
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,083
to this day nobody knows what really happened

399
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,333
to the blue eyed barbarian

400
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,500
who transformed China forever

401
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:24,291
but

402
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,250
maybe that's exactly how a Zen master story should end

403
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,833
with a question mark that makes us all think

404
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,291
after all as Bodhidharma himself might say

405
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,375
the real question isn't where he went

406
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:39,083
the real question is where are you going?

407
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,750
so what's the legacy of this mysterious

408
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,250
blue eyed monk who vanished into thin air

409
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,208
just look around

410
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,791
every Kung fu movie you've ever watched

411
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,041
traces back to his teachings at Shao Lin

412
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,208
every Zen meditation center around the world

413
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,500
follows his direct approach to enlightenment

414
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,583
even that green tea you might be drinking right now

415
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,333
is tied to one of his legends

416
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,166
but his biggest impact it's not in the history books

417
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,625
it's happening right now

418
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,041
scientists studying meditation

419
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,750
are discovering what Bodhidharma knew

420
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,250
1500 years ago that training the mind is just as

421
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,000
important as training the body

422
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,166
modern martial artists are still using his principles

423
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,208
combining physical movement with mental focus

424
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,291
and his core message

425
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:33,333
that truth isn't found in books or beliefs

426
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,458
but in direct experience?

427
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,083
that's more relevant today than ever

428
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,000
think about it this one man

429
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,541
created a martial art that spread worldwide

430
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,708
started a spiritual revolution that's still growing

431
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:48,875
showed us that physical

432
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,833
and mental training go hand in hand

433
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,666
and disappeared like a legend

434
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,083
leaving us just enough mystery to keep questioning

435
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,666
maybe that's why Bodhidharma Story still captivates us

436
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,083
today because deep down

437
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,791
we all want to believe that

438
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,833
one person can change everything

439
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,625
even if they have to stare at a wall for 9 years

440
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,416
to do it

441
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,166
so ask yourself

442
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,458
if Bodhidharma could transform his mind and body

443
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,458
to achieve something extraordinary

444
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,083
what could you change in your life

445
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,791
to unlock your own potential?

446
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,125
if Bodhidharma Story

447
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,833
inspires you to find your own inner strength

448
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,166

was he poisoned? did he return to India?

454
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,833
or did he really dissolve into light?
